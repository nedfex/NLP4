senators ' STATEMENTS 
health 
hiring of Former Parti Qu é b é cois Candidate as Administrator of Ottawa Hospital 
hon. Philippe Deane Gigant è s : 
honourable senators , something disgraceful is going on in Ottawa , and it should stop . 
i am talking about the controversy surrounding the appointment of David Levine as CEO of the new Ottawa hospital . 
there are people in Ottawa who have openly opposed the appointment because he has a P é quiste background . 
p é quistes do the same thing , but we are not like them . 
we should not ape the misguided actions of a separatist government that inquires into a person ' s political beliefs before hiring him . 
i once told a candidate that she had won a job competition . 
she replied " But , senator , did you know I was a separatist ? " 
she said she would , and I told her she had the job . 
she was loyal , too . 
that is the Canadian reality , the Canadian ideal . 
it is shameful to attack someone because of their political beliefs . 
the Economy 
report on Growth of Business on Prince Edward Island 
hon. Catherine S . Callbeck : 
in their report , they highlight the fact that along with Alberta and British Columbia , Prince Edward Island has the strongest net rate of new business starts in the 1990 s . 
much of the good growth they foresee is related to Confederation Bridge . 
however , the bridge , in the context of the report , is but a symbol for the global links that are being made and which must be maintained given what is happening on the economic front around the world . 
they offer four themes that I personally support to serve as a basis for building the Island ' s prosperity - trade readiness , skills readiness , business capabilities and fiscal responsibility . 
in 1995 and 1996 , when I was a member of Team Canada , I had the opportunity to see how important to our development are the links we have made as a country . 
the emphasis being placed on knowledge - based industries was one that was particularly striking . 
as the report points out , we are linked ever more closely with other peoples , cultures and economies and we must be prepared for the challenges ahead . 
now that we are improving links to the world and the rest of Canada , I would invite everyone to come and view these developments in action . 
the summer is a particularly beautiful time of the year to visit the Island . 
honourable senators , there is much more to do and see on Prince Edward Island than the marvels of this new business growth . 
last year , 1 million people discovered the beauty of Prince Edward Island as a tourist destination . 
this year , we expect 1.4 million people . 
i invite all my honourable colleagues here and in the other place , as well as the good people of Canada , to enjoy our renowned hospitality this summer . 
the Senate 
comments of Leader of Government 
hon. Consiglio Di Nino : 
honourable senators , on May 12 , 1998 , Senator Ferretti Barth brought to our attention the very tragic incident that occurred in Italy in which many lives were lost . 
she made a very moving statement with which I associate , as I am sure do all colleagues on both sides of this chamber . 
i regret that . 
i wanted to bring to his attention that , in my opinion , his comments were inappropriate , particularly coming from a colleague who is held in such high esteem on both sides of this chamber . 
indebtedness in Developing Countries 
hon. Nicholas W . Taylor : 
in 1996 the debt of developing countries was US $ 1.5 trillion . 
many countries are paying more than 20 per cent of their gross national product just to service their share of that debt . 
the International Monetary Fund counted 41 countries that were " heavily in debt . " 
of those 41 countries , some 32 are in Africa , in the sub - Saharan area . 
( 14 l 0 ) 
in some parts of the world , no amount of belt - tightening can realistically be expected to solve the debt problem . 
on the contrary , the growth that is required to start paying off these debts can only be expected if there is a massive investment in human , physical and social capital . 
there is a potential here , though , for a win - win solution for both debtors and debt holders , remembering that Canada is not only an exporter of materials but an exporter of capital . 
industrial countries export an ever greater percentage of their products to developing markets . 
obviously , therefore , prosperous economies in the developing world would be of benefit to Canadian businesses . 
as with many other things in life , we can do the right thing and make small sacrifices now or we can live with the consequences of inaction and pay large costs later . 
second , we must ensure that developing countries borrow under the best terms possible . 
the governments of such developing countries must be able to call on experts who are independent of both the political process and of international lending organizations . 
in other words , honourable senators , they need the economic expertise , the " buy forwards " and all the other gimmicks that are used , and advice on what currencies should be paid back , not to mention a system to help control their debt .
