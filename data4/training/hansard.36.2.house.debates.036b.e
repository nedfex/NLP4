NISGA ' A FINAL AGREEMENT ACT 
the House resumed from December 6 , consideration of Bill C - 9 , an act to give effect to the Nisga ' a Final Agreement , as reported ( without amendment ) from the committee . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
it being 5.30 p.m. , pursuant to order made on Monday , December 6 , 1999 , the House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred recorded divisions on the report stage of Bill C - 9 . 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
Mr. Peter Adams : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i know that you like me believe that this is a serious place , a place where tradition is important and where people should be properly dressed . 
i would point out that the member for Langley - Abbotsford , a member of the Reform Party , is improperly dressed . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am now able to see the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford . 
i think it might be more productive if we proceeded with the voting . 
however , normally the enforcement occurs when a member wishes to address the House . 
since we are not expecting speeches tonight and are voting , I am not proposing to take further steps at this time . 
the question is on Motion No. 1 .

i find it unfair that they have to suffer along with the rest of us . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that is not a point of order . 
if the whip of the official opposition is rising on a different point of order , I would want to hear him .

i believe everyone in the House must be fiscally responsible . 
i ask the Leader of the Opposition if he understands that this will cost $ 2.4 million by tomorrow night . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
that is not a point of order . 
Mr. Preston Manning :

the next question is on Motion No. 17 . 
a negative vote on Motion No. 17 requires the question to be put on Motion No. 18 . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i bring to your attention the sixth edition of Beauchesne ' s , page 98 , citation 329 on quorum in the House . 
will I be allowed to quote from Beauchesne ' s on this point of order ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Yes. 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
let me do so . 
it states : 
the Standing Orders of the House are virtually silent on the subject of Members ' dress . 
standing Order 17 requires that a Member who wishes to speak must rise uncovered . 
while the wearing of hats in the Chamber has a respectable historical tradition , Speakers in recent years have frowned on unorthodox headgear . 
it goes on : 
many Speakers have ruled that male Members must wear a jacket , shirt and tie , and on rare occasions , such as Burns Day - 
it is not Burns Day . 
citation 330 states on page 99 states : 
a jacket and tie are required to be worn by male Members . 
we have at least two members in the Reform Party who are not following procedure . 
we object to that . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same point of order . 
it appears that we will be here for a while . 
i notice the member for Davenport does not have a tie on but that does not bother us . 
i think people can vote as they see fit . 
it would be different perhaps if we were giving speeches . 
i think we can handle it okay . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
if we are only going to be here for a few more minutes I am sure hon. members will want to put their jackets on . 
it is quite clear that the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest is correct . 
the Chair is not intending to be a stickler on the subject of dress . 
i have made it clear that no member who wishes to rise on a point of order will be recognized unless that member is properly attired . 
i would hope that members will behave accordingly . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
no , Mr. Speaker , neither do we because , as the member for Saint John pointed out , it is costing the Canadian taxpayer between now and tomorrow morning $ 2.5 million . 
i contend that a member cannot rise in this place to vote without proper attire . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the point of order by the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest is well taken . 
members who are not properly attired will not be counted in the voting . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
the Deputy Speaker : 
here on in . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , it does seem to me that only a Tory would worry about a tie when there are billions of dollars that we are all voting on here tonight . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
well , we all try to help one another . 
the question is on Motion No. 17 . 
a negative vote on Motion No. 17 requires the question to be put on Motion No. 18 .

once again I stand to ask for unanimous consent in the House to allow the pages to go home . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
Mr. Bob Kilger : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i do not doubt that everyone feels the same way about what the pressures of a student might be while he or she is a page in the House , but I understand that the House has already provided shifts for the pages so that in fact they will not be here all evening as the rest of us might be . 
we certainly do take the opportunity to wish them all well on their exams . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am not sure that was a point of order either .

i understand that it is late and we have been at this for a long time . 
as members know , and I direct this to a particular member , the House has long established rules of conduct and of deportment . 
one of them is the wearing of jackets . 
i would ask the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford , in respect for the House , to wear his jacket . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order to ask for clarification from the Chair . 
do members have to wear their jackets only if they are voting or otherwise ? 
if members are not voting , surely they do not need to have their jackets on at this time of night . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the rule is a longstanding one that has to do with deportment in the House .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
if the motion that we are about to vote on , Motion No. 42 , were to pass , it would not be necessary to proceed with the other amendments . 
if it does not pass , we are here until at least Thursday or maybe Friday . 
you might therefore wish , Mr. Speaker , to ask the House if it wishes to defer the vote on Motion No. 42 so that members might reflect longer on whether the minister ' s stubbornness is worth the price . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the next question is on Motion No. 42 . 
i know people are getting tired and tempers may or may not become frayed . 
there will be a certain amount of kibitzing back and forth , but if there is any meanness in the kibitzing it could deteriorate very quickly . 
i would ask all members to be very judicious in the choice of words that they are throwing back and forth .

we have had a lot of detailed little rulings tonight about whether we need a tie or a jacket on and something else . 
it is my understanding that a person is supposed to rise in his or her place to be counted for a vote . 
the minister of Indian Affairs , whose legislation this is , did not bother to stand up for the last vote or for a number of votes . 
i suggest that his vote should be subtracted from the total .

Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
it is remarkable how similar the Liberals and Tories really are in the House of Commons . 
i must say that by virtue of having a sign such as this , it reminds me of how much in the trough both the Conservatives and the Liberals are . 
Mr. Peter Adams : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i heard you rule on the sign . 
i wonder if you could rule on the sign that I have been using which says that the Reform Party is costing us $ 30,000 an hour . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i do not think any of the interventions have been helpful to the Chair , with all respect . 
is this a different point ? 
i do not want to hear more about costs . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
no , Mr. Speaker , it is not about costs . 
it is about some of the words that were fired over to us during the last voting procedure particularly angry that the NDP only got 2.5 % in the byelection - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
this is the same kind of helpful comment . 
we will move on . 
Mr. Jim Jones :

Mr. Derrek Konrad : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
earlier , one of the other speakers had mentioned that members should be sitting and not moving around the House while the vote is taken . 
there was so much activity on the government side , I doubt whether the results of the last vote were correct . 
i think we should vote again on that motion . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
members are supposed to remain in their seats during the taking of a vote . 
it is very helpful to the Chair and to the table officers if that were the case . 
however , I was watching the vote and I do not think there was a problem . 
Mr. John Cannis :

i noticed Bill Matthews was doing that just a minute ago .

i am also sure that members would not be taking picture in the House . 
i can assure the hon. member that this will be actively discouraged . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps you would like to ask the member as he is in the House .

i think it is very inappropriate . 
perhaps you would like to ask him what he is planning to do with it .

hon. Charles Caccia : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
since neither Erskine May ' s 22 nd edition nor Beauchesne ' s 5 th edition include the definition of abuse of and hijacking of parliament , I wonder whether you would undertake to make representation to the publishers of these august publications and recommend the insertions of these two terms , abuse of and hijacking of parliament so as to indicate the kind of abuse that this institution has been subjected to over the last 13 hours . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I think perhaps we should ask them to include the record number of time allocations and closures that the Liberals have brought in as another abuse to democracy , and that is why we are here tonight .

Mr. Jason Kenney : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i think you will find that the member for Davenport , who recently rose to express his dismay with the lack of complete authoritarian power by the government to crack this symbol of dissent , is consuming food in the Chamber . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i thank the hon. member for Calgary Southeast for bringing that to my attention . 
i would ask , as we did last night , when the vote caller is calling a particular side of the Chamber that members not stand between the vote caller and the persons being called . 
there are people coming in and out . 
we need to make it as easy as possible for the vote callers . 
obviously we will not be eating or drinking . 
we will treat this Chamber with the respect it deserves .
