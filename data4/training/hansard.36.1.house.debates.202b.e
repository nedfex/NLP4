house OF COMMONS 
Tuesday , March 23 , 1999 
[ editor ' s Note : 
proceedings resumed from Volume A ] 
government ORDERS 
government SERVICES ACT , 1999 
Mr. Speaker , I rise to introduce the bill to provide for the resumption and continuation of government services . 
but I would first like to say that the government ' s calls to reason have been heard . 
i am extremely pleased to inform the House that the joint efforts of our negotiators and those of the Public Service Alliance of Canada have resulted this evening in an agreement in principle for the 14,000 blue collar workers - 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
to confirm this , I am extremely pleased to report to the House that this evening - 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
i know that all members want to hear what the President of the Treasury Board has to say . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
i am extremely pleased to report to the House this evening that as of just a few hours ago and with much effort on the part of the government and union negotiators , we have reached a tentative agreement for striking blue collar workers . 
i think this agreement in principle is fair and generous . 
this last - minute agreement must not , however , sidetrack us from the reasons we are sitting at such a late hour . 
Canadians throughout the country have been the victims of rotating strikes by PSAC members for ten weeks now . 
not only do the effects of these strikes concern the government but they were the subject of an emergency debate in the House last week . 
this agreement in principle does not guarantee that the strikes will end . 
union members can ratify or reject this agreement . 
that is the price to be paid for respecting the right to strike , a democratic right that is part of the collective bargaining process . 
a responsible government cannot , however , wait for the decision of union members and we must therefore continue our efforts to ensure Canadians the return to the normal federal government services provided by blue collar workers and the maintenance of those services provided by correctional officers in Canadian penitentiaries . 
in recent months , the Treasury Board Secretariat has signed numerous collective agreements with over 87 % of its employees . 
the Government of Canada has shown on many occasions , including this evening , that it respects the collective bargaining process . 
this evening , the government is asking parliament to force its 14,000 blue collar workers to go back to work and to accept a collective agreement . 
we are also asking parliament to adopt measures that might be necessary to ensure that the some 4,500 correctional officers remain at work and resume negotiating as soon as possible . 
we want to avoid a strike and the absence of functional correctional services , which would pose a threat to the safety of inmates and Canadians . 
after 10 weeks , the impact of these walkouts on Canadians and on government operations is being felt . 
Canadians as much as the government can no longer accept that passenger travel continues to be disrupted in the country ' s airports . 
we cannot accept either that tax and GST collections have become so much more difficult . 
this House should know that one million taxpayers will experience delays in their tax refunds because of these strikes . 
put simply , many low income families and many small businesses will have to wait for the refunds to which they are entitled and for which they have an urgent need . 
this is not to mention the most vulnerable in our society who , every year , rely on the free services provided by Revenue Canada ' s tax clinics . 
the rotating strikes have prevented many Canadians from having access to these services . 
the operations of national defence , the coast guard and public works have been considerably disrupted by picket lines and the withdrawal of services by these workers . 
the strike also affects our grain exports , thus threatening an important sector of the Canadian economy , and also our international trade relations . 
in the port of Vancouver , dozens of ships are waiting to be loaded - 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
what I would like to know is if there is anybody today , right now , on job action . 
if that is not the case , I would like the minister to - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. House leader for the official opposition may have an excellent question but this is not the time for questions and comments . 
this is debate and the minister has the floor . 
i am afraid that is not a point of order . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , in Vancouver harbour , scores of ships are sitting idle , waiting to be loaded , which translates into expenses in the millions of dollars in each case . 
the impact of this situation on western farmers is very serious , since they can no longer move their grain to foreign markets . 
farmers cannot afford such losses and bear the negative consequences of the strike any longer . 
the situation is so serious that the president of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool , the biggest farmers co - operative in the country asked - 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
is this settlement agreed upon or is it not ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
that is not a point of order . 
the minister is making a speech on second reading of this bill . 
he is entitled to do so and I invite hon. members to allow him to conclude his remarks . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , if there has been an agreement it does not mean that it will be ratified , unfortunately . 
that means that there has been an agreement at the level of the negotiators and if we want to stop the strikes , if we want to ensure the movement of grain , we have to pass this law . 
ratification may take a number of weeks . 
it may be rejected by the workers . 
what we want to stop is the movements that have been taken by the strikers in blocking the movement of grain . 
i am sure farmers in the west understand that situation . 
the Canadian Wheat Board has revealed that it has lost sales worth millions of dollars because the delivery of the grain could not be ensured . 
at present , unless the law is passed the delivery of grain cannot be ensured . 
if parliament does not authorize the government to force workers back to work , we might lose further contracts abroad . 
this in turn would cause job losses in Canada , and tarnish our international reputation in a world where prosperity depends on foreign trade . 
increased tensions on the picket lines have resulted on occasion - 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i would like to know from this government whether or not there has been agreement to stop job action . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid the hon. member is out of order . 
the minister is making a speech on a bill . 
the member is asking questions . 
he is not raising a point of order . 
i would ask him to please refrain from interrupting so that we can get on with the debate . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
in the public interest , Mr. Speaker , the government must exercise its responsibilities with concern both for the principles that underline healthy labour relations and for sound management of the country ' s affairs . 
this is a delicate balance that pits respect for a bargaining process we believe in against the need to ensure the common good . 
the dispute between the employer and the correctional group is of a different nature and represents a particularly worrisome threat to public safety . 
without an agreement on the number of correctional officers necessary to maintain order in federal institutions , the government can no longer ensure the safety of both inmates and employees working in these institutions . 
with the agreement we have with the negotiators , while it ensures that if it is ratified the situation is solved , we cannot say that at present and the only way to prevent the strikes from affecting the movement of grain is to pass this law . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i would like to seek the unanimous of the House to have questions and comments of the minister . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious the President of the Treasury Board has reached an agreement that none of us were made aware of as these proceedings were going along . 
this is indicative of the process of negotiations over the past two or three months , in fact , over the past two or three years . 
Canadians are kept in the dark along with the union negotiators . 
that was not totally clear to us in this House . 
a bit of discussion with the House leaders before announcing it would have made all the difference in proceeding smoothly tonight and getting on with this business of getting the workers back on the job . 
we are left in the situation of looking at faulty back to work legislation tonight . 
there was a simple solution available to this government and that was to bring in back to work legislation with final offer selection arbitration as part of the terms . 
what we have here at this late time is a government trying to poke and penalize the negotiators and the union people with whom it will have to start renegotiating with tomorrow . 
the President of the Treasury Board did not sound very confident that it would not go through . 
we are left in the same situation of not knowing what is going on . 
he said he has an agreement in principle but only time will tell . 
we will be bringing in amendments to this final offer arbitration to rid of the dictative terms of this minister and this government that are totally unsatisfactory to the union people on whom he is imposing it . 
we have had unanimous agreement to allow me to share my time and I will be sharing it with the member for Wetaskiwin . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent for the member to share his time ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , being a man of few words , I am sure I will not use the remaining 35 minutes . 
i have been looking forward to the debate here tonight but when the minister comes into the House and makes an announcement as he has - 
Mr. Ren é Laurin : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
it seems to me that my colleague from the Reform Party rose on a point of order . 
you took his intervention as a point of order , but it would appear that we have resumed debate without your saying so and inviting the speakers to identify themselves . 
so are we still on a point of order about the sharing of time or have we resumed debate ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
we have resumed debate , but there is a case where time will be shared with the unanimous consent of the House . 
Mr. Ren é Laurin : 
i have nothing against that , Mr. Speaker , except that you never indicated to the House that we were resuming debate . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member for Wetaskiwin . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , it seems to me that if the government was this close to coming to a resolution of the problem in the beginning it is , to say the least , jumping the gun to bring in back to work legislation . 
i have said in the House I do not know how many times in the last few days that this is no way to cement relationships with staff . 
i suggest that is using the official opposition and everybody on this side of the House in a very suspicious manner . 
i object strenuously . 
this is a despicable move . 
why is it done at this late hour ? 
i still think it would be a great idea if we were able to question the minister under these circumstances . 
i ask once again for the unanimous consent of the House to have questions and comments of the minister for 10 minutes . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
does the House give its consent to have questions and comments to the minister for 10 minutes ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
i noticed it was not the backbenchers who said no but the minister himself who does not want to answer any questions . 
this puts an entirely different light on the situation . 
if we have a tentative agreement hammered out between PSAC and the Government of Canada , what are we doing here talking about back to work legislation ? 
why are we not talking about final offer selection arbitration or something that will - 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the hon. member asked if there would be consent to have questions and comments to the minister for 10 minutes . 
i have just verified with the minister that it certainly would be acceptable to him , to give him an opportunity to further expand on the answers he gave a while ago . 
for our part we would be agreeable to that . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i again ask the question . 
first , is the hon. member for Wetaskiwin prepared to reiterate his request because he has the floor . 
if so , are members prepared to give consent to have a 10 minute period of questions and comments to the minister ? 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
there is no consent . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , I cannot believe this . 
we have a party that says it stands for the working class , that it is going to be the champions of the working class . 
yet , it has turned down an opportunity to question the very minister who is in charge of the Public Service Alliance of Canada . 
this puts a totally different light on the situation . 
we have a situation where we are trying to legislate people back to work who are at work . 
i cannot think of a more ridiculous situation to find ourselves in . 
god knows we did not put ourselves in this mess . 
we have been advocating final offer selection arbitration as a means to settle disputes without having to go through the pain and the agony of having to legislate people back to work . 
we find ourselves in a position where we have to acquiesce and legislate people back to work . 
how do we know that he has not had this agreement for longer than two hours ? 
he tells us it has been two hours but we have no way of knowing that . 
lo and behold when the government agrees that we can question the minister , the Bloc says no . 
it is unbelievable . 
an hon. member : 
it is a credibility problem . 
an hon. member : 
what do you know about credibility ? 
an hon. member : 
pay attention . 
you will learn something about credibility . 
why are we here tonight ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
the hon. member for Wetaskiwin has the floor . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , I do not mind a little help . 
i am getting tremendous encouragement from my colleagues and even some good words of advice . 
we are going to have to completely rethink our position on this . 
things have completely changed from this morning when we started debating this . 
if I were the House leader , I would be saying that all bets are off at this moment . 
things have changed completely . 
no wonder they say that Treasury Board does not bargain in good faith . 
it does not deal with us in good faith . 
i would like one more time to ask if there would be unanimous consent for questions and comments of the minister . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
we will do that in a moment . 
there is a point of order from the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
Mr. Speaker , I am wondering if there has been a misunderstanding of the request that was made by the hon. member from the Bloc from the Reform Party . 
given some of the commotion that was taking place at the time he made the request , I would again ask for unanimous consent that the minister be permitted to take questions for a defined period , 10 minutes or more . 
i ask that that be put to the House once again . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is more than happy to keep putting this question to the House . 
might I remind hon. members that on the motion by the minister that has been moved , assuming it is carried , the House will go into committee of the whole later on this bill . 
i have no doubt that the minister will be in the committee of the whole and will be here to answer members ' questions in committee of the whole . 
i stress that that is still a possibility and I remind the House of that . 
i will put the question to the House again . 
is there unanimous consent that there be a 10 minute period of questions and comments to the minister ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
there is no consent . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , I cannot believe what I am hearing . 
i know when we get into committee of the whole we will get an opportunity to speak on our amendments and to question the minister . 
the time spent between now and when we do go into committee of the whole may be a total waste of effort . 
if we were to get some clarification from the minister at this point , if he were to be forthright with us , we may be able to save ourselves a whole lot of effort and time , if we were just able to ask the minister some questions . 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
the Chair put the question as I have done four times this evening already on this issue . 
on every occasion I have heard a no and I have never said where I heard it from , and I will not . 
other members may say so . I will not . 
i heard a no and that was the end of it . 
the Chair tries to be very attentive in these matters because we know that on occasion we have been in trouble for having tried to put something through when there has not been consent . 
i am very cognizant of the wishes of hon. members in this regard . 
let us get on with the debate . 
the hon. member for Wetaskiwin . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
if we go through with this exercise and legislate these parties back to work , parties who may or not be in a strike situation any longer , we still have done nothing whatsoever about their contract . 
we still have to have some sort of mechanism to deal with their contract . 
therefore , we need to have final offer selection arbitration . 
having gotten in that commercial message , I would ask one more time , maybe third time lucky , if we could have a 10 minute question and comment period with the President of the Treasury Board . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent for a 10 minute question or comment period to the minister ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
before we start , is the hon. member for Wetaskiwin finished his remarks or will it go back to him at the conclusion of the 10 minute period ? 
some hon. members : 
back to him . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
questions and comments to the minister . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to know from the minister just when he found out that there was a tentative agreement . 
at what time did he know that ? 
i feel that the opposition in this House has been truly sucked in by this government . 
government members knew darn well there was a tentative agreement coming and they set us up in this House . 
they made an announcement as though we should stand here and clap for them when they knew all along there was a tentative agreement . 
why is there not cessation of job action when they have a tentative agreement ? 
according to the Treasury Board official here in the back room , he says that was not attained . 
i would like to know why it was not . 
as far as I am concerned , this official opposition has some real problems now with the integrity of what went on over there . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , I knew about the agreement taking place at about 10.10 tonight . 
the agreement was the result of difficult negotiations that have continued with the blue collar workers . 
this afternoon I heard about the various elements that were involved . 
i indicated that I was ready to agree to the various contents . 
the negotiations took place between our main negotiator and Daryl Bean ' s negotiators tonight between 8 o ' clock and 10 o ' clock . 
i was told at 10.10 that they had initiated an agreement . 
the problem of course of having an agreement of that type is that since we now have a negotiated collective agreement this is what eventually , if it is ratified , must become the agreement between the parties . 
however , the possibility of the blue collar workers continuing their strike is not only there but it was mentioned to us that it was likely that it would continue because until that agreement , which is an agreement between our representatives and those of the union , is ratified by the membership , which may take one , two or three weeks , the right to strike continues . 
therefore , we still need to pass the law as it is . 
i will introduce amendments at the next stage with the possibility that the collective agreement that we have just negotiated , if it is ratified , will become the conditions of work with the parties . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , what is going on here tonight is very surprising . 
i will tell you that I worked in the labour movement for 20 years and this is the first time I see anything like this . 
i said in my speech , and I will repeat it for the minister , that this government has done all it could to push these 14,000 public servants to go on strike . 
it did all it could to provoke this strike and it did all it could to crush it . 
now the minister is telling us that there is an agreement in principle . 
we all know that , when an agreement in principle is reached under the sword of Damocles , when one is under the threat of back to work legislation , usually that agreement in principle is final . 
therefore , not only has the government succeeded in provoking that strike , but it has used the House of Commons to apply extra pressure on its employees . 
i find this totally unacceptable . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , you will have noted that there are two groups of persons mentioned in this bill . 
the first are the blue collar workers . 
i believe it is incorrect to say that , if there is an agreement in principle , it is automatically ratified because in the case of the prison guards there was an agreement in principle with our negotiators and a recommendation for acceptance by PSDAC , but then the employees rejected it . 
this is an immediate example of non - ratification of an agreement in principle . 
continuing , there are two groups of workers . 
since the rotating strikes cannot be stopped by agreement in principle , the bill must be passed so as to put an immediate stop to the rotating strikes . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question may seem quite similar . 
if the table two bargaining group has reached a tentative agreement , and seeing as there is an order from the new CIRB about the picketing on the west coast , grain shipment is not a factor any more even if the table two workers were to carry on any kind of a job action . 
would it not seem , then , that we are carrying on with the legislation for the table four workers , the CX workers ? 
is it still back to work legislation or is it designating these CX workers ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , the act is still necessary for the CX workers . 
once again , they should be designated essential and they are not . 
we need back to work legislation to prevent them from striking . 
it is still necessary for blue collar workers , because the agreement in principle by itself does not prevent them from striking . 
there have been indications that they want to continue their rotating strikes unless there is back to work legislation that prevents them from striking . 
given the fact that they can still interrupt the movement of grain , by the way all through the period until ratification and continuously if it is not ratified by them , which is a possibility , we therefore need back to work legislation . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question for the minister is very simple . 
everyone here wants to see farmers being able to ship their grain . 
how do you expect us to support the legislation when you are standing here before us tonight - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
the hon. member will address the Chair , please . 
the hon. member for South Shore will please address the Chair . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Mr. Speaker , how does the minister expect us to support the legislation when he stood before parliament tonight and said he had negotiated in bad faith ? 
he has not negotiated in good faith . 
the question is simple . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure that I understand what the member means . 
we have been negotiating with the union . 
we have been at the same table . 
we knew what the differences were between the two of us and finally tonight at 10 o ' clock we reached an agreement . 
however , the agreement itself is an agreement in principle . 
if it is not ratified the strikes can continue over time . 
therefore we need the act to prevent the strikes in the meantime , to prevent the strikes if there is no ratification by the employees , and to prevent a strike by the prison guards . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , seeing as that the President of the Treasury Board saw fit to raise tonight that he and his government had an agreement in principle , is he willing to table that agreement in principle so that we can work with it tonight ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , I know that our negotiators have initialled that agreement . 
i do not know if it can be tabled tonight . 
we obviously have at least one copy that has been initialled . 
i am not sure it is available . 
if it is , we will produce it for the hon. member . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i would like to ask for unanimous consent of the House to adjourn until we get the tentative agreement . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not say that it could be produced . 
i indicated that I would check if it could be produced . 
i have my main negotiator here . 
i can probably get the answer in a few minutes . 
if it cannot be produced , it cannot be produced . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there unanimous consent to adjourn until the document is produced ? 
some hon. members : 
Yes. 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
approximately an hour ago we were asked to vote in the House on Government Order No. 21 which dealt with the way the bill before the House at this time was to be handled . 
what that motion said was that all stages of the bill must be dealt with and we would continue debating , without ceasing , all stages including committee of the whole until such time as the bill was completed . 
prior to that vote having taken place , the President of the Treasury Board and others on the government side of the House knew that a tentative agreement in principle which directly affected the bill had already taken place . 
that information was knowingly withheld from the official opposition and the other opposition parties on this side of the House because the government knew it would affect the vote that took place on Motion No. 21 . 
in other words , the government withheld information that was critical to the decision making process of every member of parliament on this side of the House , and it did so deliberately . 
not only does the tentative agreement affect the entire process we are to go through tonight , but by deliberately keeping this information , by holding it to its chest and just saying " vote on that , commit yourself , make a decision as a member of parliament and I will just keep this information secret '' , everyone on this side of the House had to make a decision based on half - truths and innuendo when the government knew that the truth was available and yet refused to share it with us . 
when a vote comes before the House and the government deliberately withholds information that affects my decision on how I voted , I believe my privilege has been compromised . 
i would ask you to rule in that way , Mr. Speaker , because I consider it a travesty that the vote was taken when the minister kept that information from me and from every member in the House . 
that is not right and he knows it . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I can certainly understand the hon. member ' s frustration . 
he makes a good point that we did not have all the knowledge we might have been able to have before the vote . 
his frustration is compounded by the fact , as his House leader said , that they were sucked in . 
they voted for closure and now they are embarrassed that they voted for closure , that they voted for the government . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am not sure that the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona is addressing himself to the question of privilege that has been raised . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , just to respond to the question the hon. member across the way raised , which he says is a question of privilege , I do not believe the privileges of anyone have been negatively affected by anything government has done . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
i beg hon. members to listen briefly to what I will say because I intend to state to the House that in fact such was not the case . 
the President of the Treasury Board indicated that shortly after 10 o ' clock this evening a tentative agreement had been reached . 
he rushed over to the House of Commons to inform us as soon as possible . 
a vote started at eleven o ' clock . 
while the division bells were ringing , I alerted all the other House leaders that I had heard an announcement was imminent and immediately after the vote was taken the President of the Treasury Board made that announcement to the House . 
in fact what has been demonstrated is the exact opposite of what has been alleged . 
on the point raised by the hon. House leader from the New Democratic Party , if members are entitled to vote against a measure , others are entitled to vote for it . 
both propositions are equally legitimate and there is no question of privilege . 
an hon. member : 
a point of order , Mr. Speaker . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am dealing with a question of privilege . 
i will not hear a point of order until I have dealt with the question of privilege . 
i will deal with the point of order after the question of privilege has been disposed of . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , a while ago , the President of Treasury Board told us that he would look into the physical possibility of tabling the document on which there was an agreement . 
could the President of Treasury Board tell us what progress he has made in his search ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
that is not a question of privilege . 
i called for comments just on that . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly believe that my privileges in the House have been affected . 
the government House leader knew of the agreement in principle . 
we on this side of the House did not . 
we only knew that the government had some announcement to make . 
as a result , how could my privileges not have been affected by their not announcing before the vote that in fact there was an agreement in principle ? 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same point of privilege . 
the hon. government House leader has just admitted that he is in essence an accomplice to what took place because he came into the House and made reference to the fact - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
i do not think we are advancing the cause by saying what happened among various members . 
the question before the House was and is whether any hon. member ' s privileges were violated in any way by the non - disclosure of certain facts that may or may not have been in essence , as appears now from the answers we have , true at a certain time earlier this evening prior to the vote . 
the Chair ' s view is that members ' privileges of freedom of speech have not been impaired in any way by this non - disclosure . 
while members may have a grievance and a complaint , it is not one that affects their privileges . 
accordingly I feel there is no question of privilege to be raised here . 
Mr. Gary Lunn : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i would ask for unanimous consent of the House to extend the questions and comments for another 10 minutes . 
i have not had an opportunity to ask a very short question of the minister , as I am sure is the case for many members present . 
we could resolve this a lot quicker by extending it . 
i ask for unanimous consent to extend the questions and comments of the minister for another 10 minutes . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order . 
there is a certain amount of confusion here . 
the Chair was asked to ensure that , in order for the debate to progress and so that we could do our job as parliamentarians , we could be able to look at the agreement , the written text , and all the information . 
does the Chair intend to ensure that we will have that information in due course , because we submit to you that this is really where our privileges as parliamentarians are being affected ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is not in a position to ask that documents be tabled unless the House itself has asked for them . 
at the present time there is no motion or order for production of documents made by the House . 
therefore , the Chair is not in a position to do so . 
then the minister said something about that . 
we might want to debate this , but for the time being let us resume debate on the matter before the House . 
would the minister like to add something . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , I only wanted to say that according to the information I received from our negotiator , both parties have agreed not to reveal the details of the agreement at this time . 
Mr. Charlie Power : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of privilege . 
i want to make the point that my privileges have definitely been infringed upon this evening in this debate . 
i guarantee everybody ' s privileges on this side of the House were infringed upon . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid that I have already ruled on that point of order . 
it was the same one raised by the whip of the official opposition . 
that is not a question of privilege . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would like some clarification on your ruling . 
do you believe there was indeed a breach of parliamentary privilege when the government withheld information and lied to the House ? 
we would like to understand the meaning - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
members have certain privileges that are defined in the materials that are on the table . 
they can read Beauchesne ' s and Erskine May and they can read that there are certain privileges . 
members will have to continue without the agreement . 
[ English ] 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to clarify something that is very important at this time in this House . 
a deliberate omission is a grave contempt according to Erskine May ' s 22 nd edition . 
a deliberate omission is a form of contempt . 
the government deliberately misled the opposition . 
Mr. Speaker , for your information , I do know Beauchesne ' s and Erskine May , and if those members bothered to read it they would see it in there . 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to make a point regarding the House leader ' s point and that is the fact that what was presented by the President of Treasury Board this evening does not change the substance of the issue . 
it does not change the substance of the issue . 
the fact is that there was an agreement reached - 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order , please . 
it is quite clear that the points of order and the questions of privilege , while of interest , will not resolve the issue before the House . 
we are on debate and I suggest that we get back to the debate on second reading of the bill before the House . 
the Chair is running out of patience on points of order . 
i will hear a few more and then there will be no more . 
they are getting very repetitious and I cannot continue all night . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
in Erskine May , the textbook which you quoted earlier , it says that a deliberate omission by the government constitutes a contempt of this place . 
in my opinion , and I think it is pretty obvious what any layman ' s interpretation would be , there was a deliberate omission to make sure the opposition parties did not have that information in their hands when we voted on a key vote at close to midnight on a key motion on which closure had been imposed . 
if it is a deliberate omission , and by their own omission it was in their knowledge , in their presence , in their hands well before this House voted on Motion No. 21 put by the government , then it was a deliberate attempt to withhold information from the official opposition and the opposition parties in this House . 
the vote that was held afterward means that every single member of parliament on this side of the House was deliberately misled and left out of the information circle that had a crucial effect on the vote which followed . 
if that was deliberate , and if it is in Erskine May , then , Mr. Speaker , I think you should find the minister in contempt of the House and I am prepared to move the appropriate motion . 
hon. Marcel Mass é ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , obviously questions of bad faith are not mentioned here , but this is a question of bad faith . 
the motion on which the vote took place was on a motion for closure . 
it had nothing to do with the act itself . 
it is not affected , on the one hand , because the blue collar workers have not ratified the deal and can , therefore , still strike with the same effect that they have had in the past 10 weeks . 
the prisoner guards can also still strike . 
therefore , the substance of the act does not change . 
the vote that took place was on a motion for closure which was not affected in any way , shape or form by the tentative agreement that was reached tonight . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , not to belabour the point , but the question that needs to be asked is quite simple . 
were the Liberal members , especially the backbenchers in this House of Commons , given access to that information at 10.10 p.m. , long before the opposition members were ? 
that is the question . 
were the Liberal members given access to that information an hour before the members on this side of the House ? 
the whip of the official opposition is absolutely correct . 
it is quite probable in all circumstance that the Liberal members were given information long before the members of this House . 
if that is the case , the minister is in contempt . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , our point is still valid . 
the minister is incorrect in his assertion . 
the minister is incorrect . 
this government or this minister is in contempt . 
it is in Erskine May and we want it remedied tonight , now . 
Mr. Derek Lee ( Scarborough - Rouge River , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if I understand the allegation of the opposition , it is that somehow a member of the government sitting on this side of the House failed to disclose something during the debate that preceded our vote at about 11 o ' clock . 
i hope it has not escaped the notice of members opposite that , by my recollection , no member of the government front benches was speaking at that time . 
i think I recall opposition members speaking at that time . 
secondly , just prior to 11 o ' clock , as one government backbencher , I did make an attempt to ascertain the status of a number of things . 
in reply to my questions I was told that I would have to wait for the hon. treasury board president ' s speech to the House . 
i think the opposition members are whistling here at 12.40 in the morning . 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , to offer support to the House leader of the official opposition , I want to make a couple of points . 
we were told by the minister after we voted that there was a tentative agreement . 
i would suggest that what that means is that the union executive is going to recommend this to its membership . 
that is crucial information that we must have before taking the vote . 
the vote was not on closure and we are not in routine proceedings . 
we are planning to sit in this House all night , for 24 hours , and that is information that should have been provided to us . 
out of the courtesy to the union , we should be giving it an opportunity to accept that tentative agreement as opposed to turning this into a national crisis . 
that is very germane to the issue at hand . 
it is unbelievable that the minister would not come in and say , before the vote , that he had some information for the House . 
i agree that it was deliberately withheld . 
we are aware of members of the backbenches who were talking about this before they came into the House . 
that has just been brought to my attention . 
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
it is generally accepted that any threat , or attempt to influence the vote of , or actions of a Member , is a breach of privilege . 
if the minister knew this information at 10.10 p.m. , and I was asked to vote later without that same information , the minister , by not giving us that information before the vote , was trying to influence the vote . 
i use Beauchesne ' s to back up that argument . 
i ask the Speaker to rule on the issue . 
the minister knew before we voted . 
i was not allowed to vote with the full knowledge of what the minister knew . 
that is a breach of my privileges . 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this is factually incorrect . 
surely the hon. member who raised this , who was himself a speaker of a provincial legislature , knows better than to make these claims . 
it is because he is a credible member that he should not say these things . 
the title of the section that the member is quoting from is entitled " Interfering with Members '' . 
he is trying to indicate through reference to that section that somehow he might have voted differently on a previous order of the House - government Motion No. 21 standing in my name , not the one before us , Bill C - 76 , in the name of a completely different minister - and that either I or he has interfered with him . 
that is incorrect . 
so are a number of other allegations that have been made . 
when I came into the lobby at approximately 10.45 p.m. , it was the first I had heard that a tentative agreement was possible , the details of which I knew nothing and which were revealed almost immediately by the President of the Treasury Board as soon as we finished voting . 
everyone here has acted in good faith . 
everyone is trying to do what is best for the people of Canada . 
that is still our determination . 
that is still what we want to do . 
everyone in this House knows it . 
even those who are disagreeing with us know that we are working for that common good , with no other objective in mind . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have listened closely to what the hon. government House leader has said . 
however , by his very admission what we heard was that at least one other member , other than the President of the Treasury Board , knew about this . 
the point that has been made by the opposition House leader is still very relevant , that perhaps not only members on this side of the House have been denied the privilege of this information that is very telling and would impact on how members would cast their votes , but also members of the government side of the House . 
they would have very much liked to have been informed that a tentative agreement had been reached . 
this is information that was purposely withheld . 
therefore , I suggest that there is a breach of the privilege of hon. members which would impact on the way that they would cast their vote . 
it is a prima facie case . 
i suggest that there is enough evidence before the House for the Chair to make a ruling on this matter . 
Mr. John Reynolds : 
i go by section 92 : 
a valid claim of privilege in respect to interference with a member must relate to the member ' s parliamentary duties and not to the work a member does in relation to that member ' s constituency . 
the member ' s duty in this House is to vote with full knowledge of what he is voting on . 
the government House leader is correct that I was a Speaker in a former House . 
that is holding this House in contempt and they will pay the price for that with the Canadian public . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Speaker , the official opposition must be joking because the vote that has been taken is a vote on closure . 
i have checked . 
that is what Motion No. 21 does . 
Mr. Speaker , it was only after you called orders of the day that the bill was introduced for the first time . 
the information that we had an agreement in principle was irrelevant to the vote on Motion No. 21 . 
it has nothing to do with it . 
no privilege was breached . 
there was no information that was relevant for the vote on Motion No. 21 . 
i made the first speech at second reading of the bill and that speech mentioned that there was at that point an agreement in principle . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I will show the minister how much we are joking . 
when you find the minister in contempt I have a motion that I will present and table in the House . 
Mr. Speaker , at some point when you make the decision on contempt we have the motion here . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Chair is ready to deal with the question of privilege that has been raised . 
members should regard the facts of what has transpired and the explanations that have been given by hon. members who have participated in the points of order that were raised , including the House leader and the whip of the official opposition , the hon. member for Saanich - Gulf Islands , the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , the President of the Treasury Board , the government House leader , the hon. member for Scarborough - Rouge River , the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough and the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona who had something to say on this matter . 
while all the issues that have been raised are no doubt important , the fact is the Chair is in a position where a decision is to be rendered on the question of whether there has been a prima facie contempt of the House committed by the minister by reason of the failure to disclose the fact that a tentative agreement had been entered into some time earlier this evening and before the vote took place in the House on a motion . 
i want to stress the quality of this motion to the House . 
it was one that suspended the rules of the House in relation to the proceedings on this bill and we are now debating the bill before the House . 
i note that the motion that dealt with the suspension of those rules was adopted and following that the bill was called . 
on the very first speech on the bill the minister disclosed to the House that in fact an agreement had been reached . 
it was his speech , his opening remarks on the bill . 
i believe it would be out of order . 
i believe what is in order is for members to proceed with debate on the bill before the House and of course they are free to express their views as to the agreement , as to what the minister said about the agreement in the course of that debate and indeed to vote against the bill . 
i think that in the circumstances that is a reasonable way of proceeding given the fact that this agreement was achieved quite late . 
in the circumstances I believe we should now proceed with the debate and I therefore call for resumption of debate on the bill . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
Mr. Speaker , since I would have voted exactly the opposite , I request that my vote on Motion No. 21 be reversed and I be recorded as being against that motion . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
such a request will require the unanimous consent of the House . 
is there consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
if I had known what information the minister had I would have reversed it . 
i ask for the unanimous consent of the House to reverse my vote on Motion No. 21 and oppose that motion . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I seek the unanimous consent of the House to allow me to reverse my vote that was taken earlier due to the fact that the government deliberately withheld critical information . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is it agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Gary Lunn : 
Mr. Speaker , I also ask the consent of the House to reverse my vote on Motion No. 21 . 
i feel very strongly that the information was - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , we have given permission to the government to proceed in an emergent fashion in what we consider to be an emergent situation . 
because of information known only to the minister and to a few select ministers in his cabinet which was withheld from me , if I had had that information I may have voted differently . 
i ask for the unanimous consent of the House to change my vote . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid there is no consent . 
resuming debate , the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate being recognized . 
i am looking forward to entering into - 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
just so I am clear on this , you have resumed debate . 
is there a period of questions and comments or are we moving on to the next speaker ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
there are no questions or comments on the first three speakers on second reading in a debate . 
the minister was number one . 
number two split his time so there were two speakers in slot number two . 
this is slot number three . 
there will be no questions or comments . 
the member for the Bloc did not rise so I went to the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
perhaps I can clarify this . 
prior to our getting into points of order and questions of privilege , you allowed our member the additional time that was left . 
you said you would come back to him in debate . 
we expect you to honour - 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i asked him if he was finished his remarks and he told me he was . 
that is why I then went ahead with the 10 minute questions and comments period . 
we will get the blues , but it was very clear . 
i was quite emphatic with the hon. member for Wetaskiwin . 
before we began the 10 minute period of questions and comments to the minister I asked the member for Wetaskiwin if he had concluded his remarks . 
he told me he had . 
that is why I called for resuming debate and looked around to other members in the House . 
an hon. member : 
you are wrong . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the hon. member says I am wrong . 
i recall asking the question and I remember the hon. member giving me the answer . 
perhaps the hon. member for Wetaskiwin will recall whether I asked him that question and if he did not give me that answer . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , the way I recall this , when you rose and asked if I was finished or if I would prefer to continue after the debate , I nodded that I would prefer to continue after the debate . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i have no objection . 
if the hon. member wishes to continue I am prepared to go back . 
i assume the House will agree to that . 
i am not trying to cheat him out of his time . 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate that . 
i am sorry for the misunderstanding . 
it was the understanding of this House that we were dealing with - 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i and other members have heard an hon. member across accuse me of making an untrue statement to the House . 
i probably have most faults on this earth but I am not lazy and I am not a liar . 
hopefully I will have the support of hon. members when I ask that not be said in here about anybody , including me . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am sure all hon. members know that the use of the word liar is unparliamentary and that they would refrain from the use of the word . 
the Chair did not hear the word . 
if hon. members used the word I am sure they would want to withdraw . 
the hon. member for Wetaskiwin has the floor . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , when this situation was first debated in the House last week it was brought in as an emergent motion by my colleague from Selkirk - Interlake . 
we approached this issue on the basis that this was an emergency . 
part of the emergency was that there was grain shipment stoppage at the west coast ports yet again , one that we were assured would never happen again because of the provisions in part one of the Canada Labour Code . 
the industrial relations - 
Mr. Jean Dub é : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
at 10.15 p.m. the President of the Treasury Board said he had a tentative agreement and that he could share it with us in five to ten minutes . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
order . 
this question has been asked several times . 
i do not believe it is a point of order . 
we have resumed debate now and I would urge hon. members to allow the hon. member for Wetaskiwin to continue with his remarks . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
there was a grain stoppage at the port of Vancouver . 
we were assured by the labour minister of the day that would never happen again because of provisions in Bill C - 19 , the amendments to part I of the labour code . 
lo and behold exactly what we had predicted came true . 
one of the unions at the port went on strike . 
a picket line was set up and other unions refused to cross it . 
therefore , Canadian grain was not reaching port and we were losing customers that we could ill afford to lose . 
we were also under the impression that the tax centres were not operating and Canadians were desperately in need of their tax returns . 
as a matter of fact everyone knows they can file tax returns as early as January 1 . 
we were given to believe people had filed for their rebates but they were not getting them because of slowdowns and rotating strikes that were taking place by PSAC at those centres . 
now we find we have a completely different set of circumstances . 
it begs the question , what is the emergency now if we have a tentative agreement ? 
it also begs the question , if we have a tentative agreement , how does the union respond to that ? 
do the negotiators for the union go back to the union members and say " You guys had better sign this because if you do not , they are just minutes away from bringing in back to work legislation anyway '' ? 
what kind of position does this put the PSAC workers in ? 
i do not think this is any way to negotiate with employees , whether you are a staunch union person or not . 
this is no way to cement labour relations . 
i do not think this is any way to utilize the opposition parties of this House either . 
it is a very disrespectful way . 
we agreed with the Government of Canada that this was an emergency and it was going to be treated as such . 
otherwise why would we be in this chamber at 1 o ' clock in the morning debating something that we have agreement to ? 
it is absolutely insane to be doing this in this fashion . 
if the government was so close to signing an agreement with these people , the minister could have come in virtually at the eleventh hour and said lo and behold he has a ministerial statement to make that all is well but let us proceed with this back to work legislation . 
the President of the Treasury Board could have taken five minutes of time from the member from Vancouver prior to the vote and made that announcement . 
if necessary , we could have adjourned the House for 15 minutes while the caucuses determined what their positions were going to be . 
we said we are going to arrive at a position that is based on something we feel is an emergency situation in Canada and we are going to do it by consensus in our caucus . 
i am sure everybody arrived at it this way . 
excellent points have been made that not only were we labouring under lack of information that the government had but the government ' s very own backbenchers were also . 
this is an absolute sham and a tremendously disrespectful way to use parliament ' s time and resources . 
what is the emergency now ? 
i am sure a few government members will stand up on debate . 
i would like to have them explain to me where the emergency is . 
this is about the shabbiest handling of a bill . 
it defies logic . 
this is kind of a Keystone Cops situation that could only be bested in the funny papers . 
this is a sham and a ridiculous use of this institution . 
no one in the House wants to see the grain shipments flow unimpeded from the farm gates on to the high seas more than myself and my colleague from Selkirk - Interlake . 
i was pleased when through you , Mr. Speaker , and largely your efforts and your concurrence that he was able to get an emergency debate on this very issue . 
i thought hurrah , perhaps we are going to make some headway here . 
this is absolute silliness . 
the next time this government comes to us asking for back to work legislation , we are going to look at it with very jaundiced eyes . 
we are going to be extremely suspicious of its motives . 
i know Mr. Speaker will say that we must never impugn motives in this House , but when we see time after time this sort of prank , for lack of a better word , pulled in the House , then it is small wonder we should be suspicious and sometimes impugn motives . 
while we are talking about shifty operations , let us talk about last Friday . 
last Friday we were asked out of the blue with about three seconds notice to give unanimous consent to the government . 
the first thing we asked was what would the unanimous consent be for . 
i have heard that one before , the cheque is in the mail . 
we were asked to give the government unanimous consent and we said no , that we would give our consent perhaps when we had had an opportunity to assess what it was the government was asking our consent on . 
first that and now this . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
i rise on a point of order , Mr. Speaker . 
i am trying to follow this debate here . 
it seems to me as though you have lost control of the House . 
in fact , there is noise all over this place and I cannot follow the debate . 
that is my privilege and I would like it protected . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i must say that I was able to hear the debate but I am aware there is some noise in the House . 
i am sorry that the hon. member could not hear , but I know hon. members will want to hear the hon. member for Wetaskiwin in his remarks , as I am listening . 
the hon. member for Wetaskiwin . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Mr. Speaker , I know that not everyone in the House is listening to my words of wisdom , but I know Mr. Speaker is hanging on every word . 
we cannot say we want to get back to where we once were shipping grain because we never really reached a zenith . 
we always seem to be slipping back . 
we all would like to see these labour disruptions absolutely minimized . 
there are absolutely no winners in this situation . 
i know the people in the unions do not strike simply because it is 2 o ' clock on Tuesday so they are going to have a strike . 
that is not the way it is decided . 
it is a very gut wrenching decision for them to withdraw their services , to go without pay , to walk the picket line and to suffer the scorn of some of the people who pass by . 
it is a very big decision for them . 
i submit that when they have gone without a contract for two years at a time , it is small wonder that they take some kind of job action . 
we have to ask ourselves what kind of an employer would ask their employees to go without any kind of an agreement for two years at a time . 
looking back in the records I have found that since April 1997 some of the bargaining units have been totally without a contract . 
that is indefensible . 
there is no way under the sun that the minister can defend that kind of a record . 
if he had and if he had agreed to final offer selection arbitration being included in this bill , then perhaps all would not be lost . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise at this late hour in a context that was not necessarily planned , but very revealing . 
when the government House leader introduced the bill yesterday , he spoke of a sad day . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i have not made any comments in regard to what has been going on tonight . 
i would have liked some time to study the tentative agreement before I decided how I would vote . 
i request that before we continue any more debate that that vital document be tabled . 
we may have to suspend the House for the time being or do whatever we have to do , but that thing is vital to how I would have voted . 
in the meantime I ask that I be allowed to abstain from having voted on that motion . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
is there consent that the hon. member ' s vote be changed on the previous motion to an abstention ? 
an hon. member : 
No. 
the Deputy Speaker : 
there is no consent . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
Mr. Speaker , as I was saying , the government House leader said yesterday , in his presentation , that it was a sad day . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
we have talked about this tentative agreement . 
as a member of parliament I feel I have every right to have knowledge of what it is about before we carry on with the debate . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
Mr. Speaker , as I was saying - 
an hon. member : 
for the third time . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : - for the government House leader , it was a sad day , yesterday . 
today is a very sad day too . 
we are witnesses to the tragicomic behaviour of the government , which is showing the world , on television , how arrogant it can be , of what disdain it is capable . 
there is a sort of deception in its behaviour , given what it hid from us earlier . 
this confirms completely all the claims , all the frustrations that the union movement and the public service unions have criticized for a long time , whether we are talking about the Public Service Alliance or the members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , who complained of this government ' s day to day operations . 
we have a perfect and glaring illustration of that this evening . 
we will get back to the basic issue . 
we will get back to the substance as if nothing had been said , because there is not much there . 
it is all right not to bother about what the President of the Treasury Board said earlier , because it is not worth it . 
let us get back to the context of the legislation used by the government to force back to work employees who belong to the general labour , ships ' crews and trades groups , that is table 2 , and the correctional officers , or table 4 . As members know , the bargaining process was divided in seven tables . 
this is what the minister should talk about , instead of rambling like he did earlier . 
incidentally , workers in the general labour group earn an average of $ 31,000 per year . 
a salary increase is , therefore , definitely in order . 
there is nothing outrageous about such a measure , on the contrary . 
this would show some openness , particularly considering that the salaries of these workers have been frozen for six years and that they are now paid an average of $ 6 less per hour than blue collar workers in the private sector or at the municipal level . 
these Canadian public servants are earning an average of $ 6 less per hour than workers who hold similar jobs . 
before the minister ' s rambling , the state of negotiations was that a conciliation report had been submitted by a third party , the conciliator , and that report had been accepted by the union . 
perhaps the President of the Treasury Board should begin by listening and by taking a closer look at the conciliator ' s opinions and the results of his research , which was endorsed by the union . 
perhaps it would be easy for the government , the employer , to take this route . 
i think this is already expecting too much . 
the President of the Treasury Board prefers talking with another distinguished colleague , who likes to dip into workers ' pockets , much like he does . 
they make a fine pair during this debate about the future of public sector workers and of workers in general , nattering on when it would be more in the public ' s interest if they were to listen . 
we can see that Quebec is very well represented in this cabinet , the people with the real power . 
so , for table 4 there is a conciliator ' s report that has been approved by the union , while for table 2 it is high time the parties , particularly the government , agreed to binding arbitration to try to resolve the situation . 
it must never be forgotten that this is a legal strike , where in fact a strike is going on , by a legally recognized union that is part of our institutions and that has the right to strike when it feels that the offers being made are not acceptable . 
it is therefore based on a balance of power which is also inherent to our labour relations and should include bargaining in good faith and in a civilized manner . 
this is precisely what the employer , the government , has not demonstrated , in our opinion . 
we want the government to negotiate . 
the government is in a period of negotiation , but it seems to be more inclined to legislate than to negotiate . 
instead of saying that the government is more inclined to legislate than to negotiate , we should rather say that , in the recent past , since 1982 actually , bona fide bargaining has been the exception . 
the government would rather legislate . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
Mr. Speaker , could the president of the Treasury Board listen to the debate ? 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
historically , legislative action in labour relations have been a constant occurrence since 1982 . 
let me give a list . 
i did not pick year 1982 out of the blue . 
we should remember the context . 
canada has been part and parcel of the devastation that spelled setbacks in existing social benefits , and in collective agreements , including working conditions and the union movement itself . 
the Liberal government gleefully entered the fray with Bill C - 124 , an act concerning compensation that affected everybody . 
its purpose was to control the compensation of 500,000 workers in sectors directly or indirectly under the Canadian government . 
that was in 1982 . 
in 1989 , we had Bill C - 49 , an act to provide for the resumption of certain government services . 
that title is almost identical to that of the bill now before the House . 
it was back to work legislation for workers in hospitals and for ship crews , and these groups are again today the target of a special treatment . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
when my colleague from Trois - Rivi è res talks about the workers ' fate , when he talks about the employer ' s responsibilities , would it be possible for the President of the Treasury Board and for members of the Liberal Party of Canada to listen instead of throwing paper at each other - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
order , please . 
the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot makes a good point . 
it is getting late . 
we could give each other the dignity of paying attention to each other . 
if we do not want to do so , there are the lobbies for social events . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
Mr. Speaker , in 1989 , we had Bill C - 49 , a second special bill , the Government Services Resumption Act , which provided for the return to work of a particular group of employees , who were as much a problem for the government then as they are today and who have been the victims of government policy , namely hospital workers and ship crews . 
that was in 1989 . 
in 1991 , two years later , the Public Sector Compensation Act imposed all conditions of employment , leaving no room for negotiation , mediation and arbitration . 
in 1992 , the next year , Bill C - 113 , the Government Expenditures Restraint Act , provided for a two year extension of the salary freeze and the term of the collective agreement . 
in 1993 , Bill C - 101 , an act to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Public Service Staff Relations Act , gave the government the right to impose a vote on its final offers in the course of any negotiations within the public service . 
in 1994 , Bill C - 17 , the Budget Implementation Act of 1994 , extended the collective agreement and the wage freeze for another two years , for a total of six years of wage freezes . 
the government pushed back the collective agreements already signed , arbitrarily using and abusing its legislative powers when it was in fact acting as an employer in this context . 
the same thing happened in 1995 . 
as members can see , almost every year , some special legislation was passed . 
bill C - 76 , the Budget Implementation Act of 1995 , provided for the elimination of 45,000 positions in the civil service . 
in fact , it was more like 55,000 jobs that were abolished . 
this was direct interference in the collective bargaining process and had devastating effects on some classes of employees , including the general services group represented at table 2 who saw the number of positions reduced by 41 % between 1995 and 1998 . In the general labour and trades group , the number of positions dropped by 33 % . 
for a government that brags about creating jobs , it introduced bills that had a devastating impact on the labour movement and on the job situation . 
the last of this series of legislation , except for the bill before the House tonight , was Bill C - 31 , the Budget Implementation Act of 1996 , which truly undermined the financial security and job security of employees . 
this bill provided for contracting - out and also suspended - and we are still reeling from that initiative - for three years the right to go to arbitration as a way to settle disputes . 
there is one point to be made on this issue . 
it is a little easy in the government ' s situation . 
besides , it does not matter whether it is Conservative or Liberal , this proves our point that it is all the same . 
in that regard , it always boils down to the same thing , more or less , with respect to the Constitution . 
as for labour relations , it is more or less the same people who think the same way . 
it is a little too easy , when we see how the government can restrict the recourse to arbitration and , at the same time , refuse to limit and suspend its power to designate employees who , as we know , have different prerogatives and powers since they are designated . 
so in 1999 , we have this Bill C - 76 , which is a back to work legislation . 
this legislation can legitimately be referred to in terms of a bludgeon or big stick legislation . 
when we think of the very modern means this government used in its response to demonstrators who came legitimately to show their discontent , we know that dogs were used . 
we have seen it here in Ottawa . 
some people have been bitten . 
in the history of that culture , when talking about demonstrators , we know that police grab people by the throat in order to intimidate ordinary citizens . 
so this illustrates very well the culture of this government , which is going nowhere and has in fact been the object of the interest of not only Canadian organizations but also international organizations . 
the Canada Labour Relations Board , in its wisdom , blamed the government at least twice for its actions as a legislating employer . 
the International Labour Organization also blamed the Canadian federal government four times . 
the " most beautiful and best country in the world " was blamed four times by the International Labour Organization , which represents not only governments but also unions and employers . 
on four occasions since 1982 , this government has been blamed internationally in its management . 
we know what it means to belong to the ILO , the International Labour Organization . 
the ILO ' s statement of principle provides - and the Government of Canada has made a commitment to it , as member - that : 
in freely joining the ILO , all Members have endorsed the principles and rights set out in its Constitution and in the Declaration of Philadelphia , and have undertaken to work towards attaining the overall objectives of the Organization - 
all Members , even if they have not ratified the Conventions in question , have an obligation arising from the very fact of membership in the Organization , to respect , to promote and to realize , in good faith - 
- the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those Conventions . 
these principles include , the freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining ; the eradication of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation . 
unless it can be proven otherwise , Canada is still a member of the ILO . 
that means that it is violating both the spirit and the letter of the convention it signed . 
an hon. member : 
shameful . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
the way this government has dealt with labour relations has resulted in a negation of the Public Service Alliance members ' right to negotiate freely during eight of the last fifteen years . 
during eight of the last fifteen years , we have been forced to adopt legislation and our working conditions were legislated on . 
in the case of the hospital services and ships ' crews groups , salaries and working conditions have been legislated on during eleven of the last fifteen years . 
this is totally unacceptable . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier : 
he is not here . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
No. He is one of those who do not listen . 
he distinguished himself when he was in opposition , much more so than as a government member for that matter . 
he distinguished himself as a member of the so - called rat pack . 
he was very aggressive then . 
so aggressive , so compassionate that a few years ago he was on the picket lines with the Public Service Alliance members to condemn the conservative government . 
and today ? 
he is now one of the main participants in this debate to oppose the same Public Service Alliance of Canada , which he supposedly supported only a few years ago . 
this is typical of this government : a bunch of hypocrites . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
there is an aspect that this government seems to completely overlook , and that is what happens the day after workers have been forced to go back to work . 
what about the managers ' attitude ? 
what kind of attitude can we expect from these people ? 
where is the incentive for public service managers and , more importantly , for the public servants who are being treated with such arrogance and contempt today ? 
if the government can show such contempt for the House of Commons as it did this evening , imagine what these people are capable of on a daily basis , with employees who must be respectful and loyal , particularly since job security is very tenuous within the federal public service . 
underneath all this lies a real human resources management issue . 
there is an issue of actual productivity to be expected from employees who are well treated , well understood and well respected by their employer . 
we do not have that . 
even the tiniest of small businesses , whose owner is all worked up because of the market situation , is not worse . 
this government manages like an incompetent boss with a piecemeal approach to dealing with human resources . 
let us hope that there will be a huge political price to pay . 
i am thinking about the members from Quebec , starting with the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
they will have to pay a huge political price for their lack of credibility . 
when they come to us with their talk of social union , we will remember , because this is the same disdain that we sense in the House today for workers as for in the provinces , Quebec in particular , where there is no recognition of Quebeckers as a people , no longer even any recognition of Quebec as a province like the others . 
slowly but surely , the provincial governments are becoming regional governments in this new Canada they are concealing from us , this unitary and centralized Canadian . 
an hon. member : 
totalitarian . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
totalitarian it is . 
what we are dealing with here is a dictatorship in the making . 
no need to mince words . 
a dictatorship in the making that is re - elected every four years , particularly with the unique Liberal Party of Canada , which acts as if it personally owned all the institutions . 
in my opinion , the reign and the domination of this government are coming to an end . 
as for Quebeckers , we know how to leave all this behind in short order . 
we should all be feeling a great sadness . 
the government House leader was right in his opening remarks . 
i wish public service managers all the best in the days , weeks and years ahead , because this sort of event is not forgotten . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad to be able to join the debate even though it is the middle of the night . 
i have mixed feelings about being able to speak now . 
i firmly believe that we are being dragged through nonsense for nothing , to sum it up . 
in fact we saw the government move very close to the union ' s position when talks broke off on March 12 . 
everybody seems to want to know what was in the tentative agreement . 
i know exactly what was in it . 
it went from 30 months to 24 months . 
it went from 2.5 % to 2.75 % , which was the union ' s position on March 12 , although it wanted a 30 cent upper . 
i cannot understand it . 
personally it is very frustrating . 
that is table two , the 14,500 - odd trades people . 
the government seems to have found a way to solve the problem and put these folks back to work . 
another thing in the agreement is the zones , the real reason the workers from Atlantic Canada felt it was necessary to take the drastic measure of withholding their services . 
the zone pay is offensive to everyone who has spoken to it . 
the government found satisfaction there . 
now it will merge the Atlantic provinces with Quebec into one zone . 
that makes sense . 
that is what the union was calling for all along . 
that is common sense . 
it is a natural district with a community of interest and similar costs of living . 
now the government seems willing to let the union do that . 
the third difference is that Banff will be rolled into British Columbia for the purposes of pay zones . 
again that is exactly what the union asked for on March 12 before talks fell apart and the workers had to hit the bricks . 
if we found the will , the money and a way a couple of weeks later , it begs the question why . 
that is why I say it is absolute nonsense . 
it leads me to believe that it was ideologically driven . 
the government had it within its ability to settle in that regard as well . 
the conciliation board came down with a ruling on March 19 to which the union agreed . 
it said it could live with it but the government said no and two days later tabled back to work legislation . 
why is the government not honest about what it really wants to do ? 
why does it not come through the front door and say it wants to designate these 800 workers as essential services ? 
then we could deal with it . 
we could have an honest debate about it . 
it should not try to achieve something by subterfuge or by stealth , which is what it boils down to . 
we have been hearing a lot of passionate speeches from very odd sources . 
we have had to listen to members of the Reform Party , although I see they do not have the same courtesy to stay and listen to us . 
what a crock , frankly . 
i do not know how much we can get away with saying after midnight , but what absolute excrement . 
Mr. Jay Hill : 
i rise on a point of order , Mr. Speaker . 
i wonder if you would inform my hon. colleague who is speaking now for the socialists that there are Reformers in the House and that it is not up to him to mention whether or not members are present . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. member is quite correct . 
we do not refer to the presence or absence of other members in the House . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting . 
while we are on the subject of the Reform Party and its role with unions and its reputation about being great trade unionists , that party sent around a book to the various members of parliament . 
that book came to every member of parliament to promote right to work legislation which everybody here knows is a misnomer for a legislative agenda specifically designed to stop workers from doing their job of elevating the wages and working conditions of the people they represent . 
it is a very detailed , complex book . 
what we have heard over the past couple of days is the Reform Party saying that it has been speaking on behalf of workers , et cetera , and then tonight voting for closure , voting to shut down debate . 
the great champions of the working class . 
it is actually quite galling . 
it is very galling for me as a trade unionist to have to listen to that . 
it is valuable to spend some time and talk about that basic democratic right . 
now that we have moved off the debate on closure we are on the substance of the issue , the actual bill , the back to work legislation . 
the right for workers to withhold their services is basic and fundamental . 
it is recognized in our charter of rights and freedoms . 
in the history of impasses and any kind of long protracted arguments or battles things used to fall to violence , whether it was a skirmish over a border or any other kind of long disagreement like that . 
what we have in labour relations is a way to try to solve that . 
it is through free collective bargaining - 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
i am really sorry to interrupt the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre . 
was it the hon. member ' s intention to split his time with the hon. member for Palliser ? 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
i will be using the full 20 minutes . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
the hon. member has 12 minutes left . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
Mr. Speaker , let us look at the reasons workers take that drastic step of withholding their services . 
it is a tool and an instrument to apply pressure to a situation , an argument or a debate . 
we believe it is the only really effective tool workers have to try to elevate the standards of wages and working conditions for themselves , their families and the people they represent . 
it should not be tampered with and it should not be entered into lightly when one withholds anyone ' s rights . 
it is getting to be more and more common . 
it is a slippery slope in this House . 
twice in the very short period I have been here we have had to go through this whole debate and we have seen people having that right withheld . 
we come from a caucus that believes all labour has dignity . 
we believe that fair wages benefit the whole community . 
we believe that the workers involved in this job action have very justifiable grounds for doing what they did . 
it has been pointed out by many speakers that they have had seven years without a raise . 
some of the trades people in table 2 have gone 15 years without a negotiated settlement . 
their settlements have been imposed for that whole period of time . 
is this the country that believes in the right to organize and the right to free collective bargaining ? 
last June I had the honour of going with the minister to the ILO in Geneva . 
in light of the adverse pressures of this country that would see unions stamped out I was very proud to see our Minister of Labour stand up at the ILO and reiterate the fact that Canada does agree with and supports the right to organize , the right to free collective bargaining and yes , the right to withhold services , the right to strike if deemed necessary . 
it is quite a contradiction to be standing in the House six or eight months later having this debate and watching the government side quite willingly go down the road that would simply strike those rights and freedoms that workers should have . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
this fire killed many factory workers in this terrible sweatshop . 
the owners of this factory used to lock the doors from the outside because they were concerned factory workers were stealing chicken byproducts . 
the workers were stealing the gizzards and the wingtips to take home and make soup . 
this was a right to work state so the women were very poorly paid . 
this factory caught on fire for the third time and 128 women died scratching at the doors trying to get out . 
that happened in 1991 . 
where unions are not given the ability to function and prosper and do their job , we see standards slide as in the right to work states which is what the Reform Party is promoting here . 
in the free states of the United States where free collective bargaining is still allowed and not legislated away , we see much higher social conditions on just about every measurement we can think of , whether it is wages , money spent on education or health care issues . 
i think we should pause and reflect when we are engaged in such an unsavoury pastime as taking away worker rights . 
i think it is fitting that we take pause and reflect on what unions have done over the years to make our communities better places to live . 
i want to dwell a bit on the actual case in point which is the strike that is about to be terminated by this back to work legislation . 
i have been getting a lot of letters sent to my office from public service alliance members . 
these are personal letters , some handwritten , from people encouraging and thanking the NDP for all we are trying to do to keep their issue alive . 
these people are reminding us about the issues of not just the pay zones but the differences in pay between the public sector and the private sector . 
it used to be that it was almost comparable . 
now that spread is $ 5 , $ 6 , $ 7 an hour different because wages have been frozen for so many years . 
workers have fallen way behind . 
workers can take some comfort that even though they got a lower wage they had job security . 
over the last couple of years there is no more job security . 
everybody in the public sector is working with that sword of Damocles hanging over their heads . 
after that added insult to injury there was always the comfort level that they got lousy wages and not much in the way of job security but there was a reasonable pension plan . 
people could feel good about that . 
on April 15 the President of the Treasury Board announced he was going to loot the surplus of the pension plan , take the $ 30 billion surplus out of the pension plan and use it for God knows what . 
i would think there is a huge political price this party will pay if it has the unmitigated gall to dip its hands into that pension plan and try to take that surplus . 
that is workers ' money . 
it is deferred wages . 
it is paid to workers for their purposes . 
if there is any surplus , it should go to indexing the pension to raise benefits or give it back to the workers who actually deserve that . 
when I talk about a political price , the irony is that an awful lot of public sector workers vote Liberal , which has been a long history and tradition of public sector workers . 
everybody knows that Tory times are tough times . 
what do they get for it ? 
looted pension plans , about a third of the civil service laid off , kicked right out of a job , frozen wages for six , seven , eight years . 
thanks a lot . 
i think they are fed up . 
i think the some 150,000 members of the public service alliance are justifiably angry and there will be a political price . 
it hurts me as a trade unionist to even have this debate , especially in the middle of the night . 
it hurts all of us to be here , I suppose . 
it is such an unnecessary thing . 
as I said at the start of my remarks , we should not be here at all . 
if the government had the money to sweeten the offer tonight , why did it not have it on March 12 and prevent this whole disaster , this whole two or three weeks of misery that it put people through ? 
we cost out what the spread is . 
they have lost more than that by closing down the ports and with the impact of the strike in that period of time . 
it is does not add up from a cost point of view . 
another matter is the way this whole back to work legislation has been treated . 
this is the package , 534 pages without an executive summary , without even any reference to what the wage increase was to be . 
people have to go up with this book the size of a Manhattan phone book to their offices to try to tabulate and calculate the offer that we are being asked to vote on . 
when government members give us a book that size and then tell us we are to have time allocation and closure , not only is there no time to debate this properly , there certainly was not time to go through it . 
we think this collective agreement that forms part of the back to work legislation is probably loaded with all kinds of , if not deliberate changes that we cannot find , omissions that we do not have time to find , omissions such as the one on page 3 that in the English translation contemplates same sex couples and in the French translation says that a common law spouse is a union between a man and a woman or talks about people of the opposite sex . 
that is just one example we found without digging too hard . 
we found that in the first five minutes . 
how many more errors are there in this pile of stuff here that we are forced to deal with ? 
they have not lost a day ' s time . 
they are not on strike . 
how do we vote people back to work who are not even out on strike ? 
it is ludicrous . 
the question we need the Treasury Board minister to answer is why he will not accept his own conciliation board recommendations for settling the table 4 talks . 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , tonight the government has achieved what some would consider previously to have been the impossible . 
it has united trade unionists with fervent believers in the free enterprise system in opposition to its inaction in creating this crisis tonight . 
we just heard from a trade unionist describing his opposition to the government in its position on this issue which led to the crisis tonight . 
as someone who believes strongly in the free market , I recognize , as does our party , the importance of the trade unionist movement within the free market . 
without the labour movement the free market cannot operate effectively . 
this early morning debate on Bill C - 76 is an example of what happens with a visionless , leaderless government . 
the direction that this government has refused to take has led to this crisis tonight . 
this is a government that only deals with issues once they have reached the boiling point . 
only once the issues have reached a crisis will this government actually look seriously at addressing an issue . 
it will not deal with issues that appear on the horizon and take a long term approach to solving the problems . 
it waits until the crisis develops . 
it is 911 government and it is unacceptable . 
for instance , we were told that there was a $ 9 million grain sale lost due to the government ' s inaction this week . 
some information I have on the difference between the final offer that the government made and what the union had agreed to previously was about $ 8 million . 
this government spent $ 3.6 million on marketing the recent budget because the budget was not good enough to sell itself . 
it spent $ 500 million to cancel a helicopter contract . 
this government has no sense of priorities , except the priorities of political expedience . 
this government is not interested in addressing the long term issues that affect Canadians , particularly going into a new millennium . 
to avoid these types of important issues affecting Canadians which lead to these kinds of crises is completely irresponsible . 
it is appalling for a government of Canada to behave in this manner . 
in fact , in Canada the private sector has leaped ahead of government in human resource and labour management . 
for instance , Chrysler Canada was one of the first companies in the auto industry to have unions represented on its board of directors . 
in companies today management is working with employees to create long term plans , to address issues , to develop better products and services for better prices for the consumers . 
in doing so they are creating better morale for their employees and better services ultimately . 
the government , in its approach to labour management , is doing the exact opposite . 
it is bludgeoning the unions whenever it has the opportunity to do so . 
government has a role to lead in labour management . 
if it will not lead , we would like to see the government follow the examples of some of the companies in the corporate sector that are actually doing the right thing . 
there are examples . 
it is absolutely shameful what the government has done tonight . 
first the government let this crisis develop without taking any responsibility . 
tonight when it had the information that there was a tentative agreement , it withheld that information until after a vote , denying it to members on both sides of the House . 
it is not surprising that the government is acting in this way . 
we have seen this government act irresponsibly and in contempt of this parliament on a number of issues . 
in fact , there has been a decline in the role of the private member that has been precipitated since this government was first elected . 
our party believes very strongly that it is fundamentally unfair that the government will pay people differently based on the regions in which they live in the country . 
it is hypocritical . 
all members of this House receive the same level of pay . 
it creates a ghettoization of the public service . 
it is not consistent with the type of labour - management practices in which the Government Of Canada should be leading . 
now that the government has allowed this dispute to boil into a crisis , the government has chosen to pit the interests of one group against another . 
that is typical of this government . 
the interests of the grain farmers and people involved in the grain industry in the west are being pitted against the interests of blue collar public sector employees . 
there are a lot of agricultural interests in the Annapolis Valley , which is in my riding . 
one of the things I have always noted about farmers is that they are very fair people . 
i do not believe that any farmer in the west would feel comfortable with the fact that his or her interests were being pitted against those employed in the public sector as blue collar workers . 
it is absolutely shocking this divide and conquer attitude that the government is willing to take in pitting farmers against blue collar workers in the public service . 
tonight , after having withheld the information to this House of the fact that a tentative agreement had been reached , the government proceeded with the back to work legislation that should be used as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted . 
in my opinion , it is a violation of good faith to use this back to work legislation as a sledgehammer to bludgeon labour to create some sort of advantage . 
it is not consistent with good faith negotiations . 
the government has hit an all - time low in labour relations . 
it is continuing to drive morale in our public service lower than it has ever been . 
for any member of this House who has read the recent report from the Senate on the public sector , co - chaired by Senator Stratton and Senator Cools , they will know that our public sector in Canada is at a critically low point in its history . 
there was a time when there was pride in participation or service to one ' s country through the public sector . 
this government has systematically worked to erode the confidence that our public sector employees have in their own government and in their service to the public . 
it is absolutely inappropriate . 
tonight the government has not only demonstrated contempt for parliament , it has demonstrated complete contempt for the collective bargaining process and contempt for the public service . 
the government has refused to table the tentative agreement . 
the government deserves to be noted as having completely enshrined its role as the patron saint of hypocrisy . 
the Prime Minister claims that he cannot remember why he was marching with PSAC a few years ago . 
perhaps he also cannot remember why he claimed that he was going to rip up the GST and the free trade agreement . 
this government is not interested in consistency in policy . 
all it is interested in is power at all costs . 
the actual agreement is jeopardized by the government holding a gun to the union ' s head at this point . 
the government is actually still trying to tell the House that in some way it is negotiating in good faith . 
we do not buy that over here . 
the government is negotiating in bad faith . 
i heard one person from the Reform Party say earlier that they felt they had been sucked in and manipulated by the government . 
there are members here who would have voted differently had they had the information . 
i am pleased that our party did not support the closure motion . 
an hon. member : 
what about the farmers ? 
Mr. Scott Brison : 
i hear a Liberal member opposite ask " What about the farmers ? " 
perhaps he should have been standing up for the farmers when they needed help this past fall . 
the government sat on its hands during a time when there was a significant farm crisis and again waited until that crisis reached the boiling point before it even dealt with the issue . 
again the government is choosing to pit farmers against blue collar workers . 
it is absolutely unconscionable and unacceptable for parliamentarians to stand by and let this happen . 
i am shocked tonight at how the government is treating blue collar workers . 
i am beyond being frustrated at how the government is treating parliament and I am ashamed to have played a role as a parliamentarian in this charade that the Liberals have created . 
it demeans parliament and it demeans the rights of workers in Canada . 
i hope that with a little soul searching the Liberal members opposite will recognize , particularly those members on the back benches , that they too were manipulated tonight by a government with its power concentrated on a very small group of people . 
it not only has contempt for members on this side of the House , for the blue collar workers in PSAC , for the farmers against whom it pitted the interests of the blue collar workers , but it also has contempt for its own members on that side of the House . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
is the House ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members :

some hon. members : 
No. 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :

the Deputy Speaker :

the Chairman :

house in committee of the whole on Bill C - 76 , an act to provide for the resumption and continuation of government services .

( on Clause 2 ) 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to start the debate with some questions . 
we have many unanswered questions on this bill that I think Canadians would like answered . 
it is only right that we get answers to those questions . 
i am glad to see that the President of the Treasury Board and his officials are here . 
perhaps he could give some clarification to the Canadian people . 
he mentioned in the House that he has an agreement in principle . 
could he describe whether he has any agreement from the striking PSAC workers that the rolling pickets would cease and desist during the time that this vote is being taken ? 
it is important for Canadians to know what kind of assurances they have , if any , that the strikes or pickets are going to be held off . 
hon. Marcel Mass é ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , there are no assurances from the union that they will stop the rotating strikes or that they will not have rotating strikes between now and the time of ratification . 
since we do not know if it will be ratified , if it were not to be ratified then there is a possibility the strikes would continue . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Chairman , just a follow - up question to that . 
if the union has recommended acceptance of this contract , and I assume then that it feels this is the best deal it can make , and the government is satisfied it is the best deal , it is fair to all concerned , does the Treasury Board president not feel that he may be endangering the ratification process by what we are doing here this evening ? 
basically what we are doing is sticking a sharp stick in the union ' s eye . 
if it was all done in good faith and we are taking the union ' s word that it will promote this among its union workers , and this agreement in principle does that , I think all of us in the House say we are willing to live with it if the union and the government are happy . 
does the President of the Treasury Board not feel it is jeopardizing that ratification vote by telling the union workers " notwithstanding your agreement in principle , we are going to hit you with a great big club called back to work legislation '' ? 
the workers also know that we have come to a tentative agreement and they have not given us any assurances between the time of the tentative agreement and the time of ratification . 
we have to protect Canadian people during that period of time . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , my question for the minister relates to the definition and in particular to the provisions which are included in the collective agreement affecting gay and lesbian partners of public servants . 
as the minister knows , in other collective agreements that have been negotiated with the federal public service benefits have been extended to gay and lesbian partners . 
in the English language definition of common law spouse , the definition reads as follows : " Relationship exists when for a continuous period of at least one year an employee has lived with a person , publicly represented that person to be his / her spouse and continues to live with the person as if that person were his / her spouse '' . 
in French , the definition of common law spouse reads as follows : 
common law spouse Il existe des liens de conjoint de fait lorsque , pendant une p é riode continue d ' au moins une ann é e , un employ é a cohabit é avec une personne du sexe oppos é et l ' a pr é sent é e publiquement comme son conjoint et continue à vivre avec cette personne comme si elle é tait son conjoint . 
i wonder if the minister could clarify and confirm that it is his intention to extend the benefits of the collective agreement fully to same sex partners and that the French language definition of conjoints de fait will be amended to reflect that equality . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the member has brought that difference between the English and French definitions to my attention today . 
the English definition is the right one . 
the French definition , the one contained in the regulations , will be amended deleting the words that are not in conformity with the English version . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson : 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , yes it is . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman I would like to ask the President of the Treasury Board who is not covered under this agreement . 
which workers , please . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , basically under the agreement there are two groups that are covered , table two , the blue collar workers , and table four , the CXs , the correctional workers . 
the agreement covers only these two groups . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to ask the minister how he explains the fact that , over the years , ever since 1982 as I mentioned before in my presentation , the times when the federal government has actually managed to get along with its employees have become the exceptions to the rule ? 
how does he explain the fact that this government is incapable of finding ways to come to an agreement with its employees ? 
is there something in the process that is wrong or flawed ? 
is the problem the competence of the public servants ? 
is the problem the orders that are given by the government ? 
how does he explain the fact that the government , no matter which party is in power , is unable to get along with its employees ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , before the two groups that we are talking about , table 2 and table 4 , we reached negotiated settlements over the past two years with 87 % of our employees . 
if we include blue collar workers , this brings the number of employees with whom we have negotiated collective agreements to almost 95 % . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I have three brief questions for the minister responsible . 
would he agree to update the House specifically on the instructions he gave to the government negotiators ? 
who are they ? 
what is their background in negotiation ? 
secondly , what specifically caused him to lose confidence in the possibility of reaching an agreement with the correctional officers ' representatives ? 
at what point did he lose confidence and what specific instructions did he give to the negotiators ? 
is he going to be able to sleep tonight , knowing that he has made a mockery of democracy ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , first of all , the instructions to the negotiators for members of the correctional groups were the same as were given to most of the other bargaining tables , in other words a 2.5 % increase the first year , a 2 % increase the second year and a whole series of provisions dealing with things like parental leave , annual leave depending on seniority and so on . 
our instructions were the same . 
second , we have complete confidence in our negotiators because they have made it possible for us to reach agreements with 87 % of our employees this year in difficult circumstances . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
Mr. Chairman , my question pertains to the discriminatory practice of paying workers in one region of the country , members of the public service , less for work of equal value for the same work done in another region of the country . 
i would like to know from the minister whether there is any intention on his part or his negotiator ' s part to delve into this issue with a mind to making an equal rate of pay across the country . 
will the minister enlighten the House as to whether he is amenable to moving toward this in the future ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
this is so true that in a department like external affairs there are groups of countries defined according to cost of living , difficulty of being there , the element of nearness or being very far away , very isolated , and there are compensations for all of these factors . 
in the RCMP there are cost of living adjustments for instance . 
our regional rates adapt themselves much better to living conditions , the cost of living and local market conditions . 
in the present negotiations we have reduced the number of regional rates from ten to seven . 
that was one of the difficult parts of the negotiations but we succeeded in getting agreement between employers and employees . 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , if this back to work legislation pertains to the grain weighers , what does the minister intend to use as a method to settle the contract once he gets the workers back on the job ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , what we have in the tentative agreement is a list of conditions of work that will take place once the contract has been ratified by the workers . 
we have a tentative agreement that has been initialled by us and by the representative of the workers . 
the back to work legislation has to apply in the interim period which is between now and the time when the agreement will be ratified . 
during that period there is no guarantee that there will be ratification . 
there is no guarantee by the employees that they will not have strikes . 
the conditions of work will apply in the interim period , unless it is ratified , and they will continue to apply if it is not ratified . 
those are conditions of the present contract . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , now that table two is less of an issue and now that certain terms will be recommended by the union to its workers for ratification , I would like to ask about table four . 
we now have the report of the conciliation board to the chairperson of the Public Service Staff Relations Board . 
it is a detailed ruling that came down from the board on March 19 . 
what is it about this report that the government cannot see fit to implement knowing now that the union finds it okay ? 
why can the government not simply say now that it also accepts the findings of the conciliation board and use this as the settlement for what has been going on ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , even though we have an agreement that has been initialled by the negotiators once again this does not cover the period between now and the moment of ratification . 
for that time we still have to prevent strikes from taking place . 
we have to take into account the possibility that the agreement will not be ratified . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. Chairman , everyone knows that the very reason for this bill ' s existence has ceased to exist . 
starting now , should the government not provide instead that for the group of correction officers who are not on strike , who will not be going on strike because they are not in a legal position to do so for two days , should it not provide in the bill something that would allow 24 or 48 hours for reaching a settlement , without the legislation as such applying to them ? 
it has already been proved that there is no need for special legislation , since a settlement has been reached , while the whole principle of the bill was based on the fact that the government thought it could not reach an agreement , and an agreement has in fact been reached . 
could the government not show good faith and give correctional officers a chance to put this in a collective agreement , without having to take the special legislation route ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
again , Mr. Chairman , in the case of the blue collar workers themselves , the reason we still need back to work legislation is because there is a transition period between now and the time when the agreement is ratified , and if the agreement is not clearly ratified by the members , they have to be prevented from causing more problems for western farmers , in particular . 
in the case of the correctional services officers , in theory , they do not have the right to strike . 
they have all been declared essential . 
a strike did not take place , this time . 
of course , we cannot take the chance that the 500 or 600 correctional services officers who currently have the right to strike could actually do so , because already a riot in just one prison makes the lives of inmates and staff very difficult . 
this is why they must be included now while they do not have the right to strike . 
so the fact that they would be able to go on strike on Friday or Saturday forces us to include them . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , when this evening began there was no tentative agreement . 
now there is a tentative agreement which substantially changes the whole nature of the discussion . 
i want to ask the President of the Treasury Board a simple question . 
is it his intention to table in the House tonight the tentative agreement which we are now discussing ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
no , Mr. Chairman , and I have given an answer in this regard . 
there has been an agreement with the negotiators , the union representatives and ourselves that it would not be revealed . 
the agreement , as I mentioned , was signed late last night . 
therefore the agents of the employees want to have time to explain the agreement and present it to their members . 
Mr. Preston Manning : 
Mr. Chairman , perhaps members of the House would also like to understand what is in the tentative agreement because it affects what we are doing tonight . 
if the President of the Treasury Board cannot present the agreement or table the agreement in the House , could he at least explain the substantive points in it that make it different from the current collective agreement or the one that would be perpetuated if the legislation were passed ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
for instance , they can have five weeks of holidays after 18 years of employment rather than 19 years and so on . 
another advantage has been given to them . 
there are five steps in each classification . 
one step has been added or reduced . 
i am told that the increase that was offered to them is 2.75 % instead of 2 % and there is a small increase in the salary or wages they get per hour . 
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I have a couple of questions . 
the hon. government House leader told me earlier that he did not believe that there was any provisions for the corrections services people , but the minister just informed the House that group four , the corrections people , were included . 
are the corrections people included in this tentative agreement ? 
if there is an initialled tentative agreement I can take it that all the issues are resolved . 
if that is the case , would it not be in our interest to give the workers an opportunity to ratify it before we proceed ? 
the minister is not willing to table the document in the House for members , but the union will be taking it to its membership and it will therefore be in the public domain . 
obviously they have to know what they are voting on . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in the agreement only the blue collar workers are covered . 
the agreement that was initialled tonight covers only the blue collar workers , what we call table two , but they are both in the law . 
on the other question , there is agreement between the unions and ourselves that they would not be tabled for reasons that are easy to understand . 
yes , the union may reveal it , but we cannot break our word to the union that we would not reveal it until there is an agreement on it . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I have a couple of questions . 
could the President of the Treasury Board inform the House of what the total cost difference is between the agreement outlined in the bill now before the House and the tentative agreement that was arrived at with the table two workers ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I am told that the cost is something like $ 5 million out of a total bill of about $ 500 million . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson : 
Mr. Chairman , the obvious question that flows from that is why on earth the government put Canadian farmers and Canadian public servants through this agony for $ 5 million of taxpayers money . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the basic question is that what was asked by the unions and their negotiators was much more than this . 
the reason we have an agreement is that they have come down to a level that makes sense in terms of the employees in our view and in terms of the employer . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board has partly justified using this special bill to impose working conditions on the basis of the fact that there have been financial losses in a number of areas , including grain handling and transportation . 
could he inform the House of the total amount of the financial losses caused by these work stoppages ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the figures have varied from day to day . 
i am told that there have been up to 20 ships immobilized in Vancouver ' s port . 
there have been up to 1,300 grain cars immobilized there as well . 
a $ 9 million contract has been lost , according to the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool . 
in any event , the farmers themselves have seen their wheat exports drop significantly . 
i think that in the west it was clear that this was an emergency that was costing them millions . 
can he give us figures ? 
he made it sound terribly serious , whereas according to our information everything is going fine as far as processing returns is concerned . 
is there not something of a discrepancy between what the President of Treasury Board has announced as a major problem that required him to intervene by means of special legislation , and the reality ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
no , Mr. Chairman . 
i have been kept informed on a daily basis of the output at the Department of National Revenue by its Minister , Mr. Dhaliwal . 
in the initial weeks , the backlog in uncompleted or non - processed returns was 900,000 . 
a few days ago the Minister of National Revenue told me that the backlog was 1.2 million returns . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the Canadian Grain Commission is headed for about a $ 26 million loss over the next couple of years on its operating deficit because the volume of grain moving is such that it cannot cover its costs . 
is there anything in this agreement that prohibits the Canadian Grain Commission from either eliminating positions or doing what is necessary to create the efficiencies and effectiveness of operations so farmers and others do not have to be charged excessive user fees in order to pay these guys to stay at work doing nothing ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , there is nothing in the agreement , I am told , that affects the operations of the Canadian Grain Commission . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like clarification on the facts of the case with regard to market conditions as to zone pays and that sort of thing . 
the example of the RCMP was used . 
is it true that , as the minister stated earlier , market conditions dictate the RCMP too ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I am told there is a cost of living adjustment in the Vancouver region also because of cost of living conditions . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board said earlier that all issues had been resolved . 
he also said earlier that there was no guarantee that strike action would not be taken on the part of the union concerned . 
did the government approach the union to secure an agreement not to proceed with any strike action before ratification ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , on what grounds could the minister say that all the issues have been resolved if the union maintains a potential strike position ? 
how do we know that the tax centres , for instance , are not still vulnerable to strike action under the status quo ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the member is right to say that this is indeed the difficulty . 
the various questions that have been resolved are the questions that had to do in particular with the various clauses in the collective agreement , but the reason we have to continue with the law and bring forth back to work legislation is that this risk exists . 
we have been told that there may well be strikes between now and ratification . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the fact remains though that the CX guards , the table four correction workers , are not on strike . 
here we have back to work legislation that is ordering people back to work who are not on strike . 
surely the minister will accept how very odd this looks to the general public . 
if the real goal is to take away their right to strike in the future , why is that not coming to us in a bill that actually says that ? 
why is it tucked into the back to work legislation dealing with table two workers ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
in fact , Mr. Chairman , all the correctional workers should be designated as essential services , which means that there is no right to strike . 
it is because of a quirk , a loophole that was used , that now 500 to 600 of them have the right to strike . 
we believe that they must not have the right to strike because they provide essential services . 
we are re - establishing the position that should have existed where none of them had the right to strike . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
Mr. Chairman , why is this not coming to us by way of separate legislation dealing with designating these workers essential ? 
why is it coming to us in back to work legislation which has nothing to do with workers who are not out on strike ? 
we cannot send people back to work who are not out on strike and we should not be voting for something like that tonight . 
why is the minister not introducing some kind of legislation on a separate basis to designate these people and then we could have argument and debate fairly on that one issue ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , these people have already been designated as essential workers and they do not have the right to strike . 
as I mentioned , 500 to 600 of them now have the right to strike because of a quirk . 
we are correcting that quirk . 
because there is the possibility that these 500 to 600 would strike , and they have indicated that it was their intention to disrupt the services in penitentiaries and so on , we have to bring in back to work legislation that will prevent these people who unfortunately now have the right to strike from having that right in the future . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to ask the President of the Treasury Board if his attitude means , as far as the government ' s strategy as the employer is concerned , that he has crossed out the report by the conciliator , the neutral , impartial intervenor whose proposals were endorsed by the union ? 
does it mean that the employer does not intend to give any weight at all to this report and that it prefers to legislate strategically ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in the case of the blue collar workers there was a conciliation report that we were ready to accept but the workers decided to reject . 
we decided not to accept it . 
however , there are clauses in the conciliation report for the correctional workers that are in our opinion very useful . 
we have already indicated to the union that we are ready to accept them . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to speak to the amendment to clause 7 , but in fact it could stand for all the government ' s amendments . 
i would like the minister to confirm something for me . 
we have been told that there is no guarantee that the collective agreement resulting from the settlement that has been reached would be the one that would take precedence if it is only ratified in the next few weeks . 
given the way the clause is drafted , is there not a possibility that the government could order that the conditions in the legislation will take precedence , instead of waiting for the actual results of the bargaining ? 
is this clause water - tight enough to ensure that the settlement will take precedence over a government fiat ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
if the initialed agreement is ratified by the blue collar workers , that is the agreement that will become the contract between the employer and the employees . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I have two brief questions for the minister . 
while both teams were at the negotiating table , did the PSAC negotiators agree to forgo job action during the ratification period if the government were to give up and delay its back to work legislation ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the union has indicated that it is not ready to let go of the right to strike during the ratification time period . 
Mr. Charlie Power : 
Mr. Chairman , how long does the minister expect this ratification or rejection process to take ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the normal period for the ratification process is four to six weeks . 
in this case the union negotiators have indicated to us that they will try to do it within two weeks . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board has made no mention of the Canadian Grain Commission . 
is there anything that prohibits the Canadian Grain Commission from eliminating positions in order to create efficiency and effectiveness in the Canadian Grain Commission ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , there is nothing in the agreement on that subject . 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I ask a question specifically relating to the solicitor general group , group four . 
some time ago that bargaining group had two options other than negotiations when there was a problem . 
they could either have conciliation and the right to strike or they could have binding arbitration . 
this government has taken away their right for binding arbitration and has left them only with conciliation and strike . 
so they went for conciliation , and the conciliation panel , never mind that there was a dissenting report , there was a majority report . 
they are prepared to accept that . 
the only thing that the government has left them is conciliation and the government is rejecting that . 
it was only through a slip - up on the part of the government . 
that is why it has the problem . 
the position now is that the only thing left for these people is conciliation . 
they went that route and accepted it . 
the government is saying , " We are going to designate you so you cannot go on strike . 
we have taken away arbitration and now we will not accept conciliation '' . 
how does the President of the Treasury Board justify the fact that the government has taken away the two options they had ? 
it has taken away strike and it is going to designate them . 
how are they ever in good faith supposed to negotiate with this government when the government has totally emasculated them and taken away every opportunity for action against the government ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I am advised that even when the right to arbitration existed , the PSAC , the CXs , have never used it . 
second , the conciliation board report is a useful instrument , but as I mentioned , in the case of the blue collar workers we thought that the conciliation board report made a lot of sense and the blue collar workers refused it . 
we used exactly the same right in this case . 
also we have to remember that in the case of the CXs , in December we had had an agreement with the negotiators . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson : 
Mr. Chairman , as the minister will be aware , Canada has undertaken international obligations with the International Labour Organization and it is signatory to a number of international labour conventions . 
i wonder whether the minister could indicate whether he has gauged the acceptance of the bill which is now before the House against Canada ' s international commitments under ILO conventions . 
i would suggest through the Chair that in fact Canada is in breach of our ILO conventions through this legislation . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , we have evaluated that agreement in terms of domestic law , of Canadian law and not in terms of international law . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson : 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , our basic desire of course is always to come to negotiated settlements . 
in cases like this , I think it is clear that the domestic law predominates . 
Mr. Jim Gouk : 
the Chairman : 
i did not see the hon. member rise , unfortunately . 
the hon. member need not worry . 
i will come back to him in due course . 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I will ask a supplementary because the answer to my first question will help me with the second question . 
in response to my colleague from the Kootenays and to my colleague from Winnipeg Centre , it was not made clear to my satisfaction at least as to whether this legislation relative to the CX employees will permanently put them out of the range of strike . 
will this permanently refuse their ability to strike ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
no , Mr. Chairman . 
that is done through other means . 
it is the designation as workers in essential services . 
in the present case we have a specific problem . 
we are solving it through the back to work legislation until this agreement expires and another one replaces it . 
Mr. Jim Abbott : 
Mr. Speaker , in the definitions group specific agreement means any agreement specified in schedule 1 . 
the second part of the bill deals with schedule 2 . 
it strikes me that the government is basically saying to its workers that they have a right to strike up to the point that they want to strike . 
is that not what it is saying ? 
in other words , we are having to deal with the legislation we have at the moment at 3.40 a.m. because of the inability of the government to come to an agreement with its workers . 
having reached a point where it cannot come to an agreement with its workers , it then removes the right to strike . 
i ask the President of the Treasury Board , what is the purpose of having a right to strike for people in the public service if when they choose to exercise that right we are forced to vote on back to work legislation thereby removing that right ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in the case of the CXs , because they are designated as an essential service the right to strike does not exist . 
this has been a choice that has been made because the security of prisoners and other people is involved . 
in the case of the blue collar workers , it is obvious that the right to strike is not absolute . 
when there is an emergency situation like there is in terms of western grain , then at that point the government has the ability , and it has used it in the past , to bring the workers back to work because the security , safety or economic life of Canadians is involved . 
Mr. Jim Gouk : 
Mr. Chairman , before I start , is this the supplemental I did not get or is this a new one which will give me a supplemental ? 
the Chairman : 
if the hon. member wants it . 
Mr. Jim Gouk : 
Mr. Chairman , I want to finish off with the answer I did not get from the President of the Treasury Board . 
i specifically asked how unions and more specifically the CX employees are supposed to bargain in good faith if the government takes away every single tool that they have . 
he said that the arbitration has not been used , yet the government saw fit to take it away from them . 
now we have a situation where they are designated . 
the government is saying it still left them with the right to conciliate and strike . 
if the government does not like the report of the conciliator , it will take that right away from them too , but the government will keep rights on its side . 
we have an incredible imbalance . 
one of two items that is in this proposal of the conciliation board , and there are only two , deals with pay and training . 
i am a member of the subcommittee studying the CCRA . 
i have been in the Pacific region and I have been in Atlantic Canada . 
training is non - existent . 
guards are being asked to do a job which they do not know the details of or what the rules are because there is no training . 
that was one of the two items . 
if this is such an unacceptable conciliation report , is the government saying it does not care what they make , it does not care if they are trained and it does not care if they have any rights any more ? 
how is the CX employee supposed to bargain in good faith when the two things the government said that were their tools in the event of a failure to settle a dispute are taken away ? 
how are they supposed to negotiate in the future if they are told no arbitration , no strike and it will not accept conciliation unless it says exactly what the government wants it to say ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in fact the past history proves that we have been able to come to agreements with them . 
we were very close to having an agreement with the correctional officers before . 
there was an agreement accepted by the negotiators but , as I mentioned , it was not ratified by the employees . 
clearly , over the past years we have been able to come to agreements with them . 
there was training . 
there was another one about a study that will establish if really they are or should be equivalent to RCMP officers , and so on , and we have agreed to that one as well . 
out of the four elements we have agreed to three . 
i think our record shows that we have been able to come to agreements with them . 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I still have not received an answer to a question twice asked . 
how are the CXs supposed to negotiate in good faith with the government in the future when they are being told they are designated , they cannot go on strike ? 
they have had the right to binding arbitration taken away from them and the government has now proved that unless the conciliation report says what the government wants , it will not accept that either . 
how in the future are they supposed to bargain in good faith in light of what the government has done to them this time ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in the end it is always the market that determines if a level of salaries or wages is acceptable . 
in this case we have no problem with rates that are offered in the negotiated settlement . 
we have no problem recruiting prison guards . 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , we now have a tentative agreement . 
we have an imposed settlement , this 500 - page plus document . 
we have had questions about what is now seeming to boil down to a concern about what happens between now and ratification in terms of the government ' s concern that these people will be able to strike . 
if that is the issue , and that appears to be a very big part of the issue , I want to follow up on earlier questions by other members and ask the government why it does not bring forward simple legislation that just deals with keeping people on the job between now and the eventual ratification of the agreement , and forget about this imposed settlement that we have all been bogged down with in this place today . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
because , in fact , Mr. Chairman , the agreement may not be ratified . 
we have three problems that can only be solved by passing back to work legislation . 
the first one is the problem between now and the moment of ratification . 
that means that for two to four to six weeks the farmers in the west would be submitted to the kind of rotating strikes that have taken place in the past few weeks . 
i think we have come to the judgment that the farmers in the west are not ready to accept that . 
in terms of the CXs , as I have explained , we have to have back to work legislation that will prevent them from striking because we cannot afford a strike in the essential services in the penitentiaries . 
Mr. John Duncan : 
Mr. Chairman , my question really has not been addressed . 
the reason it has not is because I used the words " eventual ratification '' . 
the government has proved that the way it is going to bargain is that it is going to legislate people back to work anyway . 
that is a given . 
it does not have to all hinge on ratification of this agreement . 
we can talk about eventual ratification . 
in terms of the corrections officers , the corrections table , I think that surgical legislation is another option for the government rather than this huge , imposed settlement . 
can the minister please tell me why that is not an option ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in the case of the CXs , there are 500 to 600 prison guards who at present have not been declared essential services . 
they will be in a position to strike on Friday of this week . 
we have to prevent their ability to strike in this case because their work is an essential service . 
in the case of the blue collar workers , we know what the strikes have produced in the last few weeks . 
we know the state of emergency which has been created in Vancouver , as well as for western farmers . 
we want to prevent that state of emergency continuing during the period of ratification which , once again , could be two , four or six weeks . 
we have been told by authorities in the west that they cannot continue even for that period of time , even for another two weeks , without these people being prevented from having rotating strikes . 
of course we have to consider the possibility , which does exist , that ratification will not take place . 
then , obviously , we would have to have back to work legislation in any case . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I am sure that other members of parliament must have been as disturbed as I was to hear that the minister admits not even having considered whether or not this legislation was in conformity with Canada ' s commitments at the ILO . 
could the minister tell us , when it comes to labour legislation and to legislation which is arguably in violation of these international commitments , if it is the policy of the minister and of the government to not even bother subjecting this kind of legislation to an analysis which would indicate whether or not it was in violation of these agreements ? 
surely this is disturbing . 
it would have been better if the minister had said that they subjected it to this kind of analysis and came to a different conclusion than I might have come to , but the minister said that he did not even bother to consider whether or not the ILO commitments were relevant in this case . 
could he indicate if it is government policy to completely ignore the ILO ? 
if it is government policy , would he care to defend such a policy ? 
i would not . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , we operate in the context of Canadian law and Canadian law reflects public interest . 
we try to make sure , and usually we do , that the agreements we bring together are in conformity with Canadian law and meet the test of Canadian law . 
it is this parliament that passes the law . 
we do our utmost to fit this test . 
the ILO is not a test that is asked of us in terms of serving the public interests of Canadians as expressed in Canadian law . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
Mr. Chairman , this is getting to be a more and more interesting and ridiculous claim . 
i wonder what the Minister of Foreign Affairs would think of this view as he goes around the world rightly preaching the value of international agreements when the President of the Treasury Board says he is only answerable to Canadian law in this case . 
in what context would the President of the Treasury Board argue that he is answerable to international law ? 
is there any context in which he would be answerable to international law , international labour law in this case , if he is not answerable to it at all in a case like this ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , in a way , what can I say ? 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
i would like to find out from the President of the Treasury Board whether there was an offer , in the agreement , from the government and a response from the union for the people who were already on strike regarding the possibility that they might return to work as early as tomorrow , while the agreement is ratified ? 
was there an offer from the government on this , and was there a response from the union on the possibility that the employees would go back to work and the agreement would be ratified later on ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , our negotiator has asked specifically for that to be done and the negotiators for the union have said no . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Chairman , when I asked the minister if PSAC negotiators were willing to give up job action during the ratification period in return for the government giving up its back to work legislation , the minister answered that the union was not willing to give up its strike option . 
was this position forced on the union because the government would not relent and give up its right to back to work legislation ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , we believe it is in the public interest of Canadians , because of the emergencies that exist , to have back to work legislation that will prevent strikes as of now . 
that is why we want to introduce back to work legislation . 
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I wonder if the minister could tell us what will be the lower level of the hourly rate , the highest hourly rate and the average hourly rate under the new contract . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
however , we would not give out that information because we are not going to reveal the details of the negotiated agreement . 
Mr. Ted White : 
Mr. Chairman , could the minister then please give us the lowest hourly rate , the highest hourly rate and the average hourly rate under the old contract ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , my negotiator does not have that . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Chairman , I realize that we are not just asking questions here . 
i might launch into a 25 minute speech just to keep everybody ' s attention . 
then again , maybe I will not . 
i have a couple of questions for the President of the Treasury Board . 
i hope he realizes the difficulty that he has put parliamentarians in and even Canadians as they try to evaluate this bill . 
basically he is saying to vote in favour of this bill and to support the agreement , but we cannot see the agreement because it is secret . 
in other words , he is telling us to trust him . 
" i ' m from the government and I am here to help '' . 
it is one of those things that one has an awful lot of difficulty believing . 
why would he suggest that parliamentarians , and Canadians in general , would want this thing rammed through parliament , given the stamp of approval , when he cannot tell us what we are voting on because it is a secret ? 
why should we do that ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the general parameters that I have given them tonight are the 2.75 % and 2 % , plus the increase in salaries . 
i have mentioned some of the advantages , such as holidays , parental holidays and so on . 
the existing agreement is available for everybody to see . 
on that basis one can see what the general parameters are . 
as I have mentioned , we have an agreement with the union which we will not reveal because the union wants to present it to its members first . 
however , I believe it is quite clear to members what the general parameters of the agreement are . 
in terms of the CXs , I have indicated what the results were of the conciliation board , what the percentages were and why we believe they cannot be accepted . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Chairman , I do not think we could get a union worker to vote on what the minister just said . 
obviously the union would not go for that . 
yet here in parliament , parliamentarians are being asked to just trust this government . 
i guess it is something that we could live with , but it makes it really difficult to be gung - ho for . 
it is hard to vote for something that amounts to tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars , or whatever , when we are not sure of the details . 
this idea of an emergency gripping the nation is a little hard to believe . 
the grain is moving . 
that is not the emergency . 
there is nobody picketing in any major sustained way . 
i do not see an emergency there . 
emergency is a kind of an overplayed word here , I think , unless one is the victim of an overactive imagination . 
the procedure we are going through tonight of committee of the whole is a proposal that the Reform Party has made . 
each minister should go through this at the tabling of every bill in the House . 
whether I agree with the minister or not , I think it has been an excellent process to go through . 
when a minister tables a complex bill and comes in with his officials and answers questions like this for an hour is an excellent idea and would improve the House of Commons tremendously . 
i do approve of what is going on here tonight . 
i think it is great . 
during a press conference today the president of PSAC , and I cannot use the words because they are unparliamentary , said some things of the Treasury Board president that were very uncomplimentary . 
he said that the President of the Treasury Board is not correct when he said refunds from Revenue Canada are behind schedule . 
he says they are ahead of last year ' s schedule at this same time . 
in other words , he says they are ahead of where they were a year ago . 
could the President of the Treasury Board explain whether he believes the PSAC president ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I believe it is an emergency and it is important . 
the Reform Party itself judged it proper to have an emergency debate on the question . 
i listened carefully to what Reformers said and they gave all kinds of elements about western farmers that to me would indicate there was an emergency situation . 
yes , I am aware , perhaps unfortunately , of the words the president of PSAC had . 
i always speak kindly of him . 
perhaps we are both wrong in our assessment of each other . 
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to ask the Treasury Board president why he is crying a few crocodile tears on behalf of western farmers . 
the minister knows very well he has thrown up a smoke screen for the poor job that the wheat board minister has done in selling our wheat . 
western farmers have sold off - board grains at record high prices while the Canadian Wheat Board has sold less than 50 % of the wheat board grains at record low prices . 
if they want to gain some brownie points with western farmers , give us a voluntary wheat board and there will be no problem with strikes on the west coast . 
get up and act like a government and let farmers take over their own business . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I see the hon. member ' s position . 
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
did the workers from PSAC get the same wage for doing the same job as other members working for different unions within the federal government ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Keith Martin : 
Mr. Chairman , I am sorry , but that is not good enough . 
people are doing the same job with the same qualifications and the same merits as somebody else doing the same job with the same qualifications and the same merits in a different union but both working for the federal government and yet they are getting paid very disparate amounts of money . 
for example , crane operators in my riding were getting paid $ 16 an hour where crane operators in other unions working right beside them were getting paid 50 % more . 
that is a huge inequity . 
was that rectified in the negotiations that were just undertaken ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , because there are that many unions and because these rates are determined by collective agreements what we do in the federal government is let the collective agreement process determine the wages . 
this is the system we use . 
now that we are introducing the UCS , the universal classification system , we will at least have a classification system that will be standardized and will enable us to correct some of these discrepancies . 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I have a question relating to the PSAC workers , particularly in the Atlantic region . 
first , how are those local living conditions assessed , on what basis are they assessed ? 
second , are they open to change or review if the living conditions change during the life of the agreement ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , these rates could always be changed even in the middle of a collective agreement . 
they would have to be changed by mutual agreement . 
that is the process we have . 
we have adaptations every time we renegotiate these rates . 
we try to take into account local living conditions in order to get the negotiating rates to reflect local conditions . 
Mr. Peter Mancini : 
Mr. Chairman , I have a supplementary for the president . 
i know it is late and he might have forgotten my first question . 
what are the living conditions based on ? 
how are they measured ? 
what is used as the yardstick say between Saskatchewan , Nova Scotia , British Columbia , Toronto and Ontario ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board has indicated to us , as I understand it , that the government has an agreement but it really does not have an agreement . 
there are some initials on it but they really do not have to abide by anything . 
does this great announcement he made a few hours ago have any meaning whatsoever or are we in exactly the same position , from a purely practical point of view , as we were in yesterday ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
however , this agreement does not have the force of a collective agreement until it is ratified by a majority of the members . 
this agreement does not have force of law . 
it is not a collective agreement and it cannot be applied . 
however , now that we have a tentative agreement it means that since we prefer to have a negotiated settlement rather than a legislated one we will introduce amendments in the law that will permit us , if this initial agreement is ratified , to put it as the collective agreement that will serve as the instrument of relationships within the parties . 
Mr. Lee Morrison : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like to ask the President of the Treasury Board what good is a tentative agreement or a preliminary without a no strike commitment . 
it is just a piece of paper . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , once the agreement is ratified and becomes the agreement between the parties at that point there is a no strike agreement . 
there is a contract between the two parties , but until that agreement has been ratified it does not have the force of law and therefore the employees can strike . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board earlier said it was a glitch that allowed prison guards to strike . 
my understanding was an administrative error by this department . 
since PSAC does not seem to have been doing too good a job representing correctional service workers according to newspapers , they have been organized under a more militant union . 
it appears to me that the government is using grain transportation and tax returns as a cynical cover to play one group against another and it is really the correctional service that is the point of this legislation . 
if that is really the minister ' s intention would he have introduced this legislation if it were only about shipping prairie grain ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , we would have had to introduce the act purely for the CXs , for the correctional officers , given that in this case they should not have the right to strike . 
they are designated as essential and there was that possibility of a strike . 
however , in the case of the blue collar workers , we believe , and I think a lot of the people in the Reform Party agree with us , that there was a state of emergency . 
the communications from the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool , the communications from the Canadian Wheat Board , the communications from the Saskatchewan government were quite clear that there were conditions there that were threatening the livelihood of farmers and that is in good part why we are bringing in back to work legislation . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Musquodoboit Valley - Eastern Shore , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , it is impossible to have a legislative collective agreement . 
the minister and his department knew years ago that a day was coming up when 600 or 800 so - called CX workers , prison guard workers , would have a legal right to strike . 
he gives the perception to the House that it was a surprise and they were caught off guard that they would have this legal right to strike . 
why did they not bring in special legislation strictly for that purpose instead of trying to hide it through the back door and call it legislation as he is trying to do ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , if we had been able to solve that question through a negotiated settlement there would have been no need for legislation because the situation would have rectified itself through common agreement . 
in this case , because there was no agreement , we have to legislate . 
Mr. Peter Stoffer : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board has not answered the question . 
the question is quite simple . 
his department knew months ago that these workers had a legal date to strike . 
why did he make it a perception in the House that it is a surprise to him ? 
why is he including it in this massive 534 page document and calling it back to work legislation when in essence what he should be doing is introducing special legislation specifically for those workers ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I do not think so because these workers are all designated essential . 
in this case when new positions were created they had to be defined and then registered . 
when people move into existing positions they have to be reconfirmed as essential workers . 
that unfortunately was not done . 
i could say it is not the fault of Treasury Board , but this does not matter . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , the President of the Treasury Board caused much unnecessary controversy and skepticism last evening when he stood as the first speaker on second reading of the bill before us to present his statement regarding the tentative agreement . 
my question for the minister is very simple . 
he told us last night that he had learned about this tentative agreement at 10.10 p.m. and presented it to the House in vague terms after the vote was taken on the motion to expedite the passage of Bill C - 76 . 
why did he not bring the information before the House before the vote so that members such as myself could consider all relevant material that was germane to the bill ? 
why did he not bring it to the House before the vote instead of after the vote ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I thought that had been solved when the question of privilege was argued . 
the right argument is that this fact was not one that would affect the motion to expedite debate but this fact was a force essential for the discussion of the bill . 
i learned about it at 10.10 p.m. and I was here at about 10.40 p.m. 
i barely had time to change my speech in order to be able to make my first statement on that news . 
during that first statement , as the member may recall , I indicated what had happened . 
i also indicated that because of the CXs and because of the time period before ratification for blue collar workers we still needed the type of legislation that was in front of us . 
i do not want to resurrect that but that is how it happened . 
Mr. Jason Kenney : 
it did appear to us that back to work legislation might be necessary on an emergency basis . 
for that reason many of us voted to expedite it . 
i have a second question for the minister . 
for how long has the President of the Treasury Board known that his negotiating team was close to reaching a tentative agreement with the PSAC union ? 
how long did he know that they were closing in on an agreement and how long did he withhold that information from the House ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I do not agree with the term withhold , but I will go with the reason for the legislation . 
unfortunately the way that negotiations take place means that we still need the back to work legislation in terms of emergency for the CXs . 
that is clear . 
that is half the legislation . 
the other part of the legislation deals with table two blue collar workers . 
the fact that there is a period of time when strikes can take place before ratification and the fact that ratification is not assured indicate that the requirement for back to work legislation continues to exist . 
in terms of the emergency itself , we had an emergency debate . 
we dealt with that question and we came to the conclusion that there was an emergency . 
negotiations take place all the time more or less seriously . 
there was a meeting between our chief negotiator and the head of PSAC between 8 and 10 this evening . 
i was told after the final meeting between the two of them that they had reached an agreement . 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I am sure it is no secret to the President of the Treasury Board that the Reform Party very much supports the use of final offer selection arbitration . 
does he favour the use of final offer selection to settle cases like that of the grain weighers ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , these are options that could be considered . 
one of the reasons we have taken away arbitration was that we were in the process of introducing universal classification systems where all kinds of salary adjustments had to be made . 
this is why at present we do not have them , but arbitration in a number of cases is a very useful way of dealing with these problems . 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
could he comment on that for me , please ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the member probably has more knowledge of that specific type of arbitration than I do . 
if one of them is more efficient obviously we should give it more weight . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , my question for the treasury board minister has to do with some of the costs that came out of this strike . 
the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the government botched these negotiations to the point where serious financial harm happened to farmers , in particular , along with many other suppliers and service industries . 
those costs deal with added on farm storage of grains , lost sales overseas and the loss of Canada ' s reliability as an exporter . 
that will cost farmers into the future . 
i would guess that the fault is about 75 % on the government and 25 % on the Public Service Alliance of Canada in botching these negotiations . 
is there anything in that agreement to pay farmers , the innocent third parties , the moneys they have lost in this strike action ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I am informed that there are none . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
Mr. Chairman , could I get a commitment from the treasury board minister to begin an investigation to determine the exact costs to farmers and to take action through legislation to compensate them ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , we will look at these possibilities . 
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , in my riding many of PSAC members , in particular workers on the base at Esquimalt , were working at levels just slightly above welfare levels but were acting out of a sense of duty to the military for which they worked as civilian members . 
i want to know whether or not the raise these workers obtained was equal to , greater than or less than the raise we as members of parliament voted for ourselves last year . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Keith Martin : 
Mr. Chairman , these people have been legislated back to work four times . 
this is the fourth time we are attempting to do it . 
in order to avoid these problems in the future , will the President of the Treasury Board include in the contract an opportunity to engage in either final offer arbitration or binding arbitration to prevent strike actions that have impaired our economy , or a solution that would get us out of the problem of ordering these workers back to work against their will while enabling them to have a legitimate out ? 
we could develop a solution that would be fair to the government , the taxpayers and the workers who are trying to get a fair resolution to their grievances . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I underline the fact that we have been able to negotiate collective agreements with our members in more than 87 % of the cases . 
however I will consider the possibilities my hon. colleague mentioned . 
Mr. Jim Gouk ( Kootenay - Boundary - Okanagan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I would not like to leave on record two inaccuracies that were mentioned tonight . 
the first was when the President of Treasury Board said that they took arbitration away this time because of a whole series of new classifications . 
i want the record to show that the right to arbitration has been taken away for two successive years at budget time , not just for this set of negotiations . 
it was also stated that the conciliation recommendation covered four areas when it covered two . 
it covered pay and it covered training . 
the training clause was watered down so much that even I do not accept it . 
yet they were prepared to accept it . 
the President of the Treasury Board specifically said that by comparison wage parity with the RCMP was included . 
the question I would like to ask goes back to what I asked three times now and did not get an answer to except under the most insulting terms CX workers could possibly imagine . 
i asked how they could possibly negotiate in good faith with the government in the future , given that the government had taken away arbitration and given that the government had essentially rejected conciliation , had taken away their right to strike and had said it would designate them . 
his response the third time I asked the question was that if they did not like it they could quit because there were lots of people who would work for less . 
prisoners work for $ 5.65 a day . 
perhaps the President of the Treasury Board will get the prisoners to look after themselves , or maybe the CX employees could lock themselves up because it seems they would have more rights that way . 
i would like to ask this question for the fourth time to see if I can get a logical and acceptable answer . 
will the President of the Treasury Board tell the House how employees like the CX group will be able to negotiate in good faith with the government in the future when they have lost the right of binding arbitration , when the government rejects their conciliation , rules them back to work instead of allowing strikes and goes to full designation ? 
how will they negotiate in the future ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the member unfortunately will get the same answer because I do not know of any other answer to his question . 
the four elements in the conciliation report are training , parity or not with the RCMP , a step taken off the bottom and a step added at the top . 
the member is right when he says there has been a prescription for arbitration twice : one in the last budget for the reason I gave and one in the budget at the time we imposed restrictions . 
at that point we indicated that we wanted to be responsible for the settlements and did not want a referee to be responsible for them . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , we have been listening to the President of the Treasury Board saying over and over again that it is necessary to designate the 600 or 700 CX people who are left over . 
the treasury board and the Public Service Alliance met all day on March 19 to hash out the agreement that they would not do anything to go after these non - designated people , and now we are facing legislation , the heaviest hand of all , being imposed in the House of Commons . 
i guess I am asking for some explanation . 
if the memorandum signed on March 22 said that we could survive with this number of non - designated people , why is it now an emergency and all of them have to be designated immediately with such a heavy instrument or a blunt cudgel , one might say ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , the answer is easy . 
before that agreement was made , there were 900 people in that situation . 
that agreement solved it for 300 , but unfortunately it did not solve it for the 500 to 600 that were left . 
for these 500 and 600 we still have the need for back to work legislation . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
Mr. Chairman , my information shows it was actually 1,200 when the application was started on February 19 . 
the fact is that the language in here is fairly clear : 
the parties further agree the employer will not seek any change to the non - designated status of the positions in this appendix until subsequent to notice to bargain being served in the next round of bargaining involving the correctional . 
the government clearly built in a strategy on how it would get these other people designated in the next round of bargaining . 
is it not being intellectually dishonest to sign this on the 22 nd and one day later try to slam this through with the back to work legislation ? 
clearly something needs more explanation . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , I am told there was an emergency in these two institutions where these 300 people were . 
that emergency was solved for these two situations . 
however , the rest of the problem remained . 
once again that is why we have to have back to work legislation for these essential services . 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
Mr. Chairman , I would like the President of the Treasury Board to clarify one thing . 
when we were discussing blue collar workers ' salaries , we asked why people on the east coast were paid less than others . 
the case of members of Parliament was used as an example . 
the President of the Treasury Board said that certain MPs were compensated at a higher rate than others . 
i think that all MPs are paid the same amount whether they come from the east coast , from New Brunswick , from Vancouver or from Edmonton . 
i know all MPs receive the same salary . 
the only thing which is different is the travel expense budget for members who live further away . 
what was said in the House is not correct . 
people in the Atlantic provinces deserve to be paid the same salary for similar jobs as the people in the west or anywhere else . 
in the collective agreement signed with the union this evening to be submitted to its members , is there some reference to the fact that people in the east will be paid the same for the same work as those in the rest of the country ? 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
Mr. Chairman , my colleague is of course referring to the fact that federal MPs are all paid the same no matter where they come from . 
what I said earlier was that members of provincial parliaments receive different salaries . 
this can be proved . 
you only have to look at the difference between the salaries of MPs in Newfoundland , for instance , and Ontario . 
that is what I said . 
regarding regional rates of pay , I said that equity involves adapting to local circumstances and the local cost of living . 
that is what we are doing . 
if we look at the case of the blue collar workers , the Atlantic region benefits enormously under the agreement we have now . 
Mr. Yvon Godin : 
i just want it to be clear . 
it is as if the minister said to the House that MPs from Newfoundland or elsewhere were not paid the same . 
we are not at the provincial level . 
we are at the federal level . 
an MP gets the same salary whether he comes from Newfoundland , New Brunswick or Vancouver . 
do the people who work for the federal government not deserve the same salary , whether they come from Newfoundland or New Brunswick or Vancouver or Edmonton , no matter where throughout the country ? 
i am talking about salary here , not expenses . 
hon. Marcel Mass é : 
i have understood what the member has said .

( 1 ) The President of the Privy Council shall , after the coming into force of this Act , appoint a mediator - arbitrator and refer to the mediator - arbitrator all matters that , at the time of the appointment , remain in dispute between the parties in relation to the conclusion of a new collective agreement . 
( 2 ) The mediator - arbitrator shall , within ninety days after being appointed , 
( a ) endeavour to mediate all the matters referred to in subsection ( 1 ) and to bring about an agreement between the parties on those matters ; 
( b ) if the mediator - arbitrator is unable to do so , hear the parties on the matter , arbitrate the matter and render a decision ; 
( c ) ensure that any agreement or decision referred to in paragraph ( a ) or ( b ) is in appropriate contractual language so as to allow its incorporation into the collective agreement ; and 
( d ) report to the President of the Privy Council on the resolution of all such matters . 
the mediator - arbitrator has , with any modifications that the circumstances require , 
( a ) for the purposes of the mediation referred to in paragraph ( 2 ) ( a ) , all the powers of conciliation commissioner under section 84 of the Canada Labour Code ; and 
( b ) for the purposes of the arbitration referred to in paragraph ( 2 ) ( b ) , all the powers and duties of an arbitrator under sections 60 and 61 of that Act .

( b ) any decision of the mediator - arbitrator in respect of any matters that were arbitrated .

you have no doubt understood that , for the Bloc Quebecois , it is essential that we come back to a process which provides for arbitration in the negotiations between the government and its employees . 
i think there is a monumental shortcoming here , and in the past the government has taken advantage of its employees . 
this has been shown time and time again . 
it is high time that this situation be remedied . 
well aware of the good faith and the capabilities of the President of the Treasury Board , I am certain that he will implement this very fine recommendation . 
i know I am pushing it a little when I mention capabilities , but we will let the minister answer , as we know he is capable of acting in good faith if he wants to .

if we have any real commitment to the whole process of free collective bargaining , if it has not fallen completely by the wayside , we will accept the recommendations of the conciliation officer . 
the government and the Public Service Alliance jointly went into conciliation in good faith thinking that the outcome would be recommendations by that board . 
the board made the presentation after considering all the facts put before it . 
it carefully looked at the idea of harmonizing the corrections officers with the RCMP , but it actually fell short of that . 
it therefore is not a very radical recommendation . 
it is very much a compromised position in the best spirit of a good conciliation officer ' s report . 
we believe that we have put this whole thing to bed in a peaceful way and have sent a good message to the country . 
we all want to go to bed . 
we could stop short of this heavy - handed intervention of back to work legislation . 
we could have a negotiated settlement , or the next best thing to it , which is the implementation of the recommendations of the conciliation board . 
i would ask for the support of the House for the motion .

" or a master agreement reached between the employer and the bargaining agent '' . 
Mr. Chairman , this is an amendment that would make the bill more balanced . 
since it has just been decided that you can have either a collective agreement by special legislation or a negotiated agreement , this amendment is designed to ensure that the parties will be able to amend the agreement by mutual consent , not only in the case of the agreement provided for in the legislation but also in the case of an agreement resulting from an understanding reached by the two parties . 
without the amendment , we are giving additional powers in the case of the agreement resulting from the special legislation , while an agreement resulting from bargaining could not be corrected in the future , could not be adjusted to new labour market realities as they develop . 
this is an amendment that would improve the bill and is practical and functional .

hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
in the spirit of co - operation that we have tried to demonstrate this evening , perhaps the Chair would seek the same consent that it sought a while ago . 
i would invite you , Mr. Speaker , to invite the hon. member to seek the same consent again to see if it works better . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
Mr. Speaker , I no longer ask for that consent . 
i would like to speak my full time . 
we are debating Bill C - 76 , an act to provide for the resumption and continuation of government services . 
the short title is cited as being the government services act , 1999 . 
tonight we have had amendments in committee of the whole to put in place the tentative agreement that was announced tonight by the President of the Treasury Board between the government and the table two blue collar workers of the PSAC union . 
i would like to note that we have had the bill along with a booklet setting out the details and the wages that are part of the back to work legislation . 
we attempted to get the details of the tentative agreement which is now part of Bill C - 76 . 
however , we were unable to get them tabled in the House even though we are expected to debate those very provisions . 
it is not particularly fun or appropriate to have to debate something when we do not have the exact facts in front of us , but we will debate what we have . 
being the chief critic for agriculture , the one I am particularly concerned with is the grain weighers at the west coast ports . 
the second part deals with the corrections workers in our federal penitentiaries who are not designated essential . 
tonight we came to debate this back to work legislation in good faith and with good intentions . 
but tonight the government handled the issue of the surprise announcement of the tentative agreement in much the same way that I believe it has handled the negotiations with the unions over the past three months , with confusion , a lack of complete facts , and a spinning of the facts which left no trust and no faith in the process . 
back in 1993 when the Liberals took over as a majority government , many workers across the country were in a wage freeze . 
they knew at that time that the wage freeze would end . 
in 1997 the Public Service Alliance of Canada gave notice that bargaining would be taking place . 
at that time it would seem to me that it would be incumbent upon the negotiators , and I guess the ministers responsible for the negotiations , to set a timetable to ensure a bargaining agreement was in place at the expiry of the wage freeze . 
that would have had the advantage of there not being a strike because there would have been an agreement . 
if there was no agreement and a sensible and reasonable timetable had been set out by the treasury board minister , he could have looked at back to work legislation at a much earlier point . 
we ended up with a whole lot of innocent third party Canadians seriously being harmed by the negligence of the government to get the agreement in place and by the fault of a certain number of union negotiators not to work in conjunction with the government . 
i said earlier that if I were to apportion blame I would probably put about 75 % on the government and 25 % on the union . 
let us talk about what has happened in the past with regard to grain exports and the agriculture sector as it relates to stoppages due to wage negotiations . 
in the last 26 years there have been 12 work stoppages at west coast ports . 
we could think about that for a minute . 
almost every two years there is a stoppage in grain movement to the coast . 
we must remember that every time there is a stoppage of grain movement to the ships going to our customers overseas it costs our farmers money . 
it costs the union people who have to go out on strike pay and it hurts our reliability . 
this year the Canadian Wheat Board has exports of a little over 50 % of what they were a year ago . 
we are seeing the cumulative effect of our grain sales being considered unreliable to our customers overseas . 
we cannot apply a dollar and cents figure to that very easily . 
however we could look at the sales of our competitors , the Americans for instance , which are down only about 10 % as compared to ours being down close to 50 % . 
of the 12 work stoppages we see that 9 of them involved grain and 7 of those involved back to work legislation specifically because of grain stoppages . 
both the Sims commission and the west coast port inquiry identified grain disruptions as a catalyst for back to work legislation in labour disputes at west coast ports . 
i do not happen to have the chronology of the House as to who was in power over the different years , but I happen to know they involved the Right Hon. Lester Pearson , the Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau and the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker who came from my home province and was just one fine fellow . 
i look at the other side of the House and I know there are members over there who have been here for at least 28 to 30 years . 
i believe the Prime Minister has something like a 34 year record . 
if the leader on the other side cannot remember the harm , the damage and the tremendous number of stoppages of grain movement to the west coast , there is no hope of a negotiated wage settlement being done in a proper manner , on schedule , and in time to prevent the harm and the hurt by farmers . 
the Western Grain Elevator Association is representative of Sask Pool , Agricore , a new grain company out west , United Grain Growers and Cargill . 
these grain company foresaw major problems with their exports of non - wheat board grains and wheat board grains that they were handling on behalf of the board . 
on January 27 , 1999 they sent a letter to the treasury board minister and to the Prime Minister identifying that a big dark cloud was looming on the horizon , a cloud of disruption , a cloud of trade and losses to farmers , and a cloud of loss of exports of grain in particular . 
i do not think the government bothered reading that letter too much because it went ahead with its negotiating plan which resulted in the mess we see here today . 
along with my colleagues I had to force the government into an emergency debate to get this movement going . 
what did we see ? 
we saw trickery on the part of the government up to the very last moment when it brought in a surprise tentative agreement at a late hour . 
the treasury board president tonight in committee of the whole identified that he would consider the possibilities of doing an investigation and determining what were the actual costs to farmers as a result of the loss of exports during the strike by grain weighers . 
we should hold him to that . 
can we imagine the billions of dollars in loss over the last 26 years , not thousands or millions , that my grandfather and my father and the grandfathers and fathers of many people in the House suffered due to a lack of action by governments of the day ? 
the disappointment is that the present government cannot learn from the mistakes of the past , some of which were committed by present sitting members , I might point out . 
who will pay for the losses of these farmers ? 
when we look at the Canadian Wheat Board and its loss of sales due to the snow storms of 1996 - 997 , we see that the Canadian Wheat Board went after the railways . 
then later it achieved a $ 15 million settlement with CPR because farmers were innocent third parties . 
tomorrow and on future days I will be calling upon the wheat board and the government to identify the costs to farmers and to compensate them for those losses . 
the government brought forth the agriculture income disaster assistance plan . 
the agriculture minister bears full responsibility for that plan which went out to farmers . 
we found from the initial reaction of farmers who filled out those forms that the plan would not help them very much when it came to financial compensation . 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I fail to see a quorum in the House . 
i wonder if you would take a count . 
and the count having been taken : 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
we have a quorum . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom : 
Mr. Speaker , getting back to the commitment to compensate the farmers , it is absolutely vital because of the financial situation they are in which gave rise to this emergency debate . 
if there is financial hurt out there , how can the government not consider compensating farmers for financial loss caused by the government and the Public Service Alliance of Canada negotiators ? 
it is only fair . 
it is only right . 
why should farmers suffer due to the actions of other people ? 
there is nothing in Bill C - 76 that will prevent this situation from happening again on the expiry of the tentative agreement , if it is ratified . 
we will see the same old routine of the last 26 years . 
in about two years time we will see another strike , another crisis , another back to work piece of legislation , and another loss of a $ 100 million to farmers . 
there is no hope from the government as to its future commitments in two years . 
maybe the election will come along before then and I will walk over to the other side to take care of agriculture issues along with my compatriots in the Reform Party . 
we will see how that works out in the future . 
in all the comments of the President of the Treasury Board in this regard he never said that he had tried to get that back into the legislation for the 70 grain weighers in particular . 
it was kind of like the official opposition brought it up so maybe now he would think about it . 
farmers and other Canadians need a lot more than he will think about it and try to do something . 
we have covered the costs and the idea of final offer selection arbitration . 
another part that has not be thought of is that maybe the 70 grain weighers should be considered an essential service . 
they have held up 115,000 farmers who tried to ship their grain to the west coast . 
it would seem to me they are a monopoly service . 
they are essential to the well - being of a significant chunk of the population of the country . 
the treasury board minister said that the reason we needed this legislation was because between now and the point of ratification there might be another strike . 
the tentative agreement did not really cover a lot of the things that needed to be covered , including trying to have the no strike provisions put in so it did not have to continue on with hammering the democracy of this parliament with closure . 
i heard the hon. House leader from this side speak earlier about the fact that this government has used closure 50 times between the 35 th parliament and this one today . 
this closure that we are speaking on today is the 50 th . 
if that is democracy , it is democracy being abused . 
closure is the kind of legislation that should be available , but it should be used more along the lines of the notwithstanding clause as opposed to being used more in the way of the government dictatorially trying to get its way in this parliament . 
we have seen that abuse tonight and that is why we are sitting here at this early hour of the day speaking about Bill C - 76 . 
we went through hours of amendments , some of which were very good . 
my friends in the Bloc , in fact , brought up the final offer selection arbitration . 
i thought that maybe that amendment would be one that would really improve this bill . 
what did we get ? 
we saw the government members yell that great amendment down . 
as a result , we now continue on with this bill without that key part in it . 
we have in this bill a requirement about the grain that is mostly from western Canada . 
however , I would like to point out that we are also going to be talking very shortly about grain from central Canada . 
i speak particularly of Ontario , because I am a little more familiar with it . 
the seaway is going to be opening up . 
the terminals at Thunder Bay are going to be opening up and there are going to be boatloads of grain going down the seaway and out to our customers on the other side of the Atlantic to South America . 
we know there are a few Liberal members of parliament who represent the seaway area in Ontario . 
maybe we will see a lot more action to make sure that the seaway stays open and that those jobs and those farmers in Ontario are well taken care of . 
why could that not also have happened for the western farmers ? 
this government is supposed to be taking care of all Canadians , but it seems that it likes to take care of itself . 
earlier today and yesterday we heard serious allegations about the Prime Minister in regard to golf courses and hotels in his own riding . 
these allegations border on a conflict of interest problem . 
as a result , I am going to vote for this legislation because it is that important . 
western farmers cannot be held to pay for ruinous type legislation and ruinous type negotiations in labour - management talks that this government seems to be bringing forth all the time . 
i have spoken to some of the union workers there and they are not a very happy bunch . 
they have been mistreated in previous negotiations with the government and they obviously have not experienced good faith negotiations in this round of talks . 
in the Stony Mountain penitentiary we have an educational and training centre , not only for the guards and the union operators , but also for the prisoners who are housed there . 
we had a situation over the past few years where all of a sudden the contracts for that training happened to end up with a group of educators based primarily in Ontario . 
once again we see government interference . 
it is a strange method . 
i have not exactly had time to look into this , but I am giving the government notice tonight that I intend to look into it and determine just what it was that managed to have our local school boards not be able to win any of these contracts . 
all of these things add up to why these corrections workers were in the past , and still are , unhappy with the negotiations . 
that is why we once again have this legislation being brought in to force them back to work . 
i do not know why they have to be forced back to work . 
that is part of the problem in dealing with the government and I appreciate that maybe the negotiators for the unions had the same problem in getting hard facts and commitments . 
as another example of a lack of commitment , I have been arguing since early December when the Estey report came out to get a commitment from the transportation minister and the Canadian Wheat Board minister that the report actually was important , that it had to be dealt with and that it should be moved along . 
i tried to get this commitment through letters to the ministers and inquiries during question period to try to get them to move along . 
i was part of an industry group that was trying to move these ministers along and get a commitment from them . 
as of this day we still have no commitment as to where they stand on it , whether we will move ahead , move backwards or move sideways . 
that is the same lack of commitment that we see in trying to negotiate these wage agreements with the various unions around the country . 
the jobs of the 500 to 600 workers they are talking about could quite easily have been done by the other thousands of employees at the corrections offices . 
if they had set up pickets , it well may have turned out that other union workers would not have crossed their picket lines . 
once again , we would have the same situation that we have with the grain weighers on the west coast . 
when they put up a picket line the other unions would not cross it . 
now we see that the government understands that this is a problem . 
in regard to the corrections workers , it has built into Bill C - 76 the fact that while this agreement is on the go , and once it is ratified , there will not be any strike action and the work will have to continue on . 
it was vital to get the grain moving . 
we had to ensure that the western farmers were covered , as well as the west coast workers . 
however , in fairness , there should have been a negotiated settlement and we should have continued on with the negotiated settlement with these corrections workers . 
instead they will be arbitrarily forced back to work if they go out on strike , which I assume they will if this is not passed . 
we are going to see the same thing with the corrections workers that we saw with the postal workers . 
we are going to see them 16 , 17 or 24 months down the road with no contract . 
with the grain weighers , in two years , which is the average before another stoppage comes along , we will be in the House again with back to work legislation and a big crisis . 
that could happen before the next election if this bill is not improved . 
i will have to check how the House works with regard to the technicalities , but I would like to think we could move some amendments tomorrow at third reading stage that would bring in final offer selection arbitration that we so desperately need in this legislation . 
it is time that I pass along to the next speaker , who will no doubt be saying a lot of the same things I am saying . 
i have pointed out clearly where this government has fallen down . 
one last attempt to put in final offer selection arbitration will be made . 
i am going to support this bill to get these workers back to work and to keep them on the job just because of the drastic consequences there are to the western Canadian economy and the whole Canadian economy due to the lack of productivity , and for the individual farmer trying to make a go of it this spring with all the vagaries of agricultural life , such as drought , too much rain , floods and all of those things . 
this government has really turned the House off tonight by the way it has handled the closure motion and by bringing in the tentative agreement at the last minute . 
i would now ask that the member for Wetaskiwin be permitted to speak in the time remaining . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to thank the House for its co - operative spirit in allowing me time to have the last seven minutes of debate on third reading . 
we have just gone through a very arduous and painful exercise in the House and I do not think any of us are looking forward to repeating this any time soon , but the truth of the matter is that we are destined to repeat it . 
as my colleague from Selkirk - Interlake pointed out , it might not be all that long until we do have to repeat this . 
they happen over and over again . 
time and time again we have to face the unpalatable and drastic task of legislating some group back to work . 
i am totally at a loss as to know who is the winner in a situation like this . 
it is certainly not the members of this House . 
it is certainly not the government as the employer and certainly it is not the employees . 
there are no winners . 
why do we continue to put ourselves through this sort of task when it is not necessary ? 
my colleague from Selkirk talked about agriculture . 
this is about more than the farmers . 
the economy of Canada is quite dependent upon agriculture . 
agriculture is still one of the largest employers in the Canadian economy . 
the spin - off effect from agriculture is huge . 
we have all talked about the importance of our good name and reputation as a dependable supplier of goods in the world market . 
yet we find miraculously on the last day at the eleventh hour the minister comes into the House and says that wonder of wonders , they have reached a tentative deal . 
it makes us wonder whether there was a deal in the offing as we were gathering to consider this legislation . 
it makes us wonder whether both parties were utilizing the grain . 
we cannot say that labour knows that grain is a flash point , that it is a hot button . 
the government is certainly aware of that as well . 
it knows that we cannot hold up the grain shipments . 
we know that it is going to create action , action that none of us are going to enjoy . 
i am speaking specifically to the President of the Treasury Board and to the Minister of Labour . 
we need to implement final offer selection arbitration so that these matters can be settled amicably . 
we have all talked about how a negotiated settlement is far better than an imposed settlement . 
i think we all agree with that . 
in the spirit of final offer selection arbitration , I would like to move the following motion . 
i move : 
that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word " That " and substituting the following therefor : 
" bill C - 76 , an act to provide for the resumption and continuation of government services , be not now read a third time but be referred back to committee of the whole for the purpose of reconsidering all of the clauses with the view to provide final offer arbitration as an alternative to legislating agreements or workers back to work . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to know whether I must speak to the amendment immediately , or whether I speak as planned in my turn on - 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the debate is on the amendment . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
in that context , then , I advise you immediately that I shall be sharing my time with my colleague for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
does the hon. member for Trois - Rivi è res have the unanimous consent of the House to share his time ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
madam Speaker , I thank my colleagues for their understanding . 
i would like to begin by thanking all my colleagues for their very significant moral and physical support throughout this long debate which , to all intents and purposes , has dragged on since last Thursday . 
all staff in the offices of the whip , the leader and the research unit have been of invaluable support throughout the debate . 
returning to the merits of the question , there are two categories of worker particularly affected to which I wish to draw attention . 
and , before I forget , I also thank my administrative assistant , Lucien - Pierre Bouchard , who has , as usual , with the greatest of good will , been of inestimable help to me , especially intellectually . 
there are , therefore , two categories of public servants affected by the measures taken by their employer , who is also the legislator . 
first of all , obviously , I have in mind the correctional services officers , who are once again being pushed around . 
we know that these people are living the increasingly acute problems that our society is faced with , a bit like the schools , sadly . 
so , it is incumbent on the employer , the President of the Treasury Board , the Department of Justice or of the Solicitor General to take all necessary measures to ensure that these people are treated with more dignity . 
there is another group of employees that I want to talk about , that is the members of coast guard , because I am the Bloc Quebecois critic in this area . 
i had the privilege of meeting them some weeks ago , in Quebec City . 
they are very courteous and very competent and they not only provide great services to the public , in particular to the recreational boaters , but they are also very important as a group for the economy , some carrying out important rescue duties on the St. Lawrence River . 
furthermore , and this is what I want to underline and I would appreciate it if the President of the Treasury Board also took this into account , these people have made a considerable effort in terms of the restrictions , the downsizing and the restructuring in the federal public service . 
through new operational procedures , they have made it possible for the Canadian government to enhance productivity and save $ 13 million a year . 
as a reward for the sacrifices they have made , they were promised special treatment when the great negotiations came around . 
but , in actual fact , these promises have not been kept . 
i wish the President of the Treasury Board would pay attention , because these people are very deserving in view of their generous attitude towards their employer . 
they have been co - operative , innovative , creative , responsive , and they have made substantial savings possible in the operations of the department . 
today , the door is being slammed in their faces , when a commitment , at least a moral commitment , had apparently been given to them by their immediate supervisors that the government would reward them in due course . 
but nothing has been done . 
to come back in a more general way over this day , which is a historic one , once again , I have to say that every day we adopt special back to work legislation is a sad day , historically , a black day in parliamentary history . 
to better understand what is going on , we have to give some background to indicate where today ' s back to work legislation fits into the strategy of the Canadian government . 
therefore , we have to go back to 1982 . 
it can never be overstated that we are dealing here with a type of behavior that is deeply rooted in ideology . 
we are in the midst of a neo - liberal trend , where individuals like Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Reagan had all the latitude in the world , in the new global order , to set the course , for which we are now paying the consequences . 
however , it had all started earlier , when the powers of governments began to be limited in order to force them to curb their spending and give up more and more of their responsibilities . 
important measures were taken during the 1980 s and the 1990 s that led to governments giving up their responsibilities and getting rid of thousands of employees , about 55,000 employees apparently . 
as for giving up responsibilities , I will give an example . 
to cut its costs and do its share in a collective effort to reduce costs or to expand the Consolidated Revenue Fund , as we all know , the coast guard has set a new fee structure , which was imposed arbitrarily on users , especially icebreaking service users . 
the Bloc Quebecois has played a key role in bringing the government to show more compassion and wisdom . 
it made to government back off significantly in order that users , and above all foreign users , keep wanting to do business with Canada , in particular with Quebec and Montreal , at a reasonable cost . 
there were complaints about erosion . 
now there is are very serious problems . 
it seems that , in some regions in Quebec , 15 feet a year are lost to erosion . 
this is a lot . 
previously , there was an organization that felt concerned , and that was the coast guard . 
but now , the coast guard does not care . 
apparently , there was devolution of this responsibility to municipalities . 
to turn to the Government of Quebec is out of the question ; it would be too embarrassing . 
but municipalities do not have money , they do not have a budget for that , and everyone is passing the buck . 
i know that , in my region , Trois - Rivi è res , in the riding of Champlain , huge rocks were used for back filling so in the spring there would no longer be the disastrous erosion . 
so , this is a very practical example of what happens when the public service is attacked rather blindly and much more ideologically than claimed . 
it all happens without discussion , vision or transparency . 
an hon. member : 
we have had it . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : 
it is just beginning . 
the minister responsible for regional development should get used to it , because if there is one department that is the subject of all our criticism , it is his . 
they like to attend all sorts of meetings to sing the praises of Canadian federalism as part of the government ' s only strategy , which is to be visible on the eve of a new election . 
they excel with public coffers , as we saw recently in Trois - Rivi è res , where for $ 200,000 they were after rather abusive things in terms of visibility . 
this is the only real concern of the government . 
in 1982 , 1989 , 1991 , 1992 , 1993 , 1994 , 1995 and 1996 , there was special back to work legislation , an intrusion into the field of labour relations involved in existing collective agreements . 
it is disgraceful . 
it means that negotiating in good faith has become the exception for this employer , who also makes the laws . 
it has become the exception when the exception should be - and common sense tells us this - that the government , at times , when a situation becomes too difficult and the public interest is at stake , would resort to its lawmaking powers . 
today , it prefers to legislate rather than negotiate . 
that is typical of this government . 
the farmers know it and the International Labour Organization knows it too . 
it is not for nothing that the ILO has on four occasions blamed the government , Progressive Conservative or Liberal , it makes no difference . 
for those who are unaware , the ILO is made up not just of governments and unions , but also of bosses , the good old friends of this government . 
when one thinks of the Liberal empire in Canada , one immediately thinks of the healthy campaign funds that keep it going . 
so when these influential people criticize the federal government , it is no small matter and should be a source of concern for the President of the Treasury Board . 
as a good manager , he should be worried . 
he should be embarrassed today to have behaved like certain of his predecessors and taken the extreme action he is still taking today to force people back to work . 
the President of the Treasury Board and the minister responsible for regional development are not the only ones to have shown their true colours . 
we could mention the Minister of Human Resources Development and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , but especially the government House leader right now . 
we mentioned him in our first speech . 
the member for Glengarry - Prescott - Russell is a good example . 
historically , he has always been very aggressive . 
the government House leader has been like that throughout his career . 
that was how he was seen by the Prime Minister in the days of the rat pack . 
he made a name for himself in labour disputes , even supporting PSAC members on picket lines . 
what has become of his motivation today ? 
what has become of his convictions ? 
they are nowhere in evidence . 
he is now in charge of doing the government ' s dirty work , while he used to unequivocally support the positions of the unions , which look a lot like the positions the union is still defending nowadays . 
let me conclude , much to the relief of the two stooges , by once again urging the President of the Treasury Board to take some responsibility for the consequences these so - called negotiations and the passing of special legislation will have . 
can the President of the Treasury Board imagine what the atmosphere in the workplace will be like day in and day out in the departments , now that the government has again use its special power , which is becoming the rule , now that both management and workers have again realized that the government has shown them no respect and no recognition and has treated them badly . 
it will be nasty . 
i used to be a Quebec public servant , and things can get very nasty when decisions come from on high , when arbitrary and drastic measures are taken , as they were today , and especially when workers realize that their employer , instead of showing them some respect , would rather make their lives miserable . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , you seem to be full of energy this morning , just like me . 
first of all , I will begin by repeating that something extremely sad - 
hon. Don Boudria : 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i ask for unanimous consent of the House so that the members who unfortunately could not participate in the vote taken about an hour ago at the report stage of Bill C - 76 could have their names recorded . 
i will read the names of these members and I would ask for unanimous consent of the House so that they could be recorded as having voted . 
these parliamentarians are the hon. member for Saint - Jean , the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm , the hon. member for Rosemont , the hon. member for T é miscamingue , the hon. member for Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans , and the hon. member for Terrebonne - Blainville . 
i ask that they be recorded as members having voted against the government ' s motion at report stage . 
i will submit a copy to the clerk . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
is there unanimous consent to allow the Bloc members whose names have just been read to be considered as having voted ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
madam Speaker , in spite of the fact that a new day is dawning on Parliament Hill , you can easily see that we are still very much in the gloom , because this is an extremely dark day for democracy . 
no parliamentarian deserving of the name can be proud of what has occurred in the last few hours . 
what happened ? 
the government imposed special legislation on workers , not just ordinary workers , but people who carry out their duties under extremely difficult conditions . 
i am referring of course to correctional officers , who work in prisons . 
their right to a negotiated collective agreement was denied , rejected and trampled on . 
there will be a price to pay for this . 
this government has a rather ambiguous attitude . 
when it comes to equity , the general behaviour of government members is somewhat like The Silence of the Lambs . 
however , when the time comes to act repressively , like a dictator and with a total lack of consideration for our most democratic values , I must admit that - and I will name him , even though I have some affection for him - the government House leader is among those most despicably involved in this repressive process . 
we will remember that . 
we will remember this day in March , when the government stomped on people ' s most democratic rights . 
before going into the full significance of today ' s vote , I must thank those who have been with us through this night . 
i am referring to the guards , the library staff , the cafeteria staff , our support staff , particularly Jean - Fran ç ois Lafleur who was extremely helpful . 
those people showed strength in adversity because they knew that with the Bloc Quebecois they could build democracy . 
they have , through the years , allowed the voice of those who believe in negotiation to be heard in parliament . 
i cannot find the words to say how sad and disappointed we are . 
all the more so since in our everyday contacts with the President of the Treasury Board , we found that he was rather a pleasant person to deal with . 
how could this man fall into this trap , which is the first step towards a lack of democracy , which will lead him to the worst abuses ? 
nothing in his personality inclines him to such behaviour , except for a lack of vigilance we do not accept . 
we refuse , as members of Parliament , to be required , in 1999 , to deny workers who fulfil an essential task in our society . 
i cannot understand why the President of the Treasury Board acted the way he did . 
a few hours ago , he informed the House that an agreement had been reached with representatives of one of the bargaining tables . 
on the basis of what logic and for what reason did the minister not give negotiations another chance ? 
would it not have been possible to reach a negotiated agreement in the next few days ? 
this government cannot behave the way it does without exposing itself to being punished by the voters . 
it will be , and it will have deserved what it gets . 
the saddest thing is to see how some government members are pharisees , whitened sepulchres . 
when they were in opposition , they could not find words strong enough to condemn those abuses and it was quite something to see them praising the values of dialogue , commitment and negotiation . 
do members think that our fellow citizens believe this kind of utterly hypocritical rhetoric , where , when they are on one side of the House , they say one thing , and when they are on the other , they say something else ? 
this is not the kind of political game we , in the Bloc Quebecois , want to play . 
we sovereignists have too much respect for the institutions of parliament to accept such a behaviour . 
i would like to say a few words about the member for Outremont who , first of all , is a lawyer and has a great deal of respect for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 
as a member of parliament who has a good knowledge of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and who knows that it is part of the modern Canadian identity , how can he accept that , today , the government is trampling on one of its principles , the right to negotiate one ' s working conditions ? 
there is one word to describe that kind of behaviour and that word is pharisee . 
what is really at stake here ? 
since it was elected in 1993 , the government has been utterly incapable of showing respect for public servants . 
the federal public servants are the people who deliver services to our fellow citizens every day . 
they do so under trying conditions . 
as we know , they are doing it under trying conditions because of our ageing population , because of pressure on the public service , because our fellow citizens are living longer and need services more frequently . 
on the darker side , the track record of the government is one of compulsive , chronic , recurrent and sustained incapacity to negotiate with its employees . 
i say it again , the Liberals will pay for it at the next election because , in a few years , when we go over their track record we will remember their arrogance and intolerance . 
again , the public can count on the opposition , the Bloc Quebecois , as an efficient ally to fight against this kind of behaviour , which is unacceptable in a democratic country . 
Mr. Michel Guimond : 
contempt will be short lived . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
as my colleague for Beauport - Montmorency - C ô te - de - Beaupr é - Î le - d ' Orl é ans said , contempt will be short lived , even in ministerial garb . 
this being said , I would like to show , through a number of examples , what this government is like in action , what makes it tick . 
is this government the one that passed pay equity legislation ? 
they cannot because they have not done it . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
despite all the pressure , they have not moved on the issue ; we will remember this . 
the obscure screams of the famous backbenchers will not change a thing . 
and the screams of the obscure backbenchers will not change a thing . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
order , please . 
i would ask you to please join me in listening to what he has to say . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
madam Speaker , you would do this House a big favour if you would provide a sedative , at the expense of the opposition if necessary , to the member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , and I assure her that this is just a friendly remark . 
on the issue of pay equity , this government ' s record is not good . 
all the members of the rat pack were mobilized on this issue . 
can somebody tell us where we are today on this issue ? 
do we have in the Canada Labour Code provisions similar to those that exist in Quebec ? 
the answer is a shameful no . 
let us look at this government ' s record . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
madam Speaker , I would ask the members to remain calm because there is nothing I want more than to enlighten this House , especially government members . 
the member for Trois - Rivi è res , whom the House should applaud for his excellent work - 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
an enlightened spirit like few others on that side , the hon. member for Trois - Rivi è res reminded us earlier that , in recent years , nearly 50,000 jobs were eliminated in the public service . 
and the President of the Treasury Board was the killer of those jobs . 
was that done democratically ? 
was that done through negotiations ? 
was that done with respect for the workers ? 
No. They were forced to take severance packages that often fall short of their expectations . 
the member for Glengarry - Prescott - Russell must not forget that this behaviour is shameful and that the government should repent . 
i also want to address another stigma . 
where was the member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine when the reform was brought down ? 
the Silence of the Lambs . 
where was she when it became increasingly difficult to qualify for maternity benefits ? 
where was she when the qualifying conditions for first time workers became tougher ? 
had it not been for the Bloc Quebecois , this would have gone unnoticed . 
that is the reality . 
i cannot say it strongly enough , it is a sad day . 
it is a very sad day , indeed . 
you have before you a concerned and sorrowful man . 
rest assured that we will never accept a situation where workers , the very ones who are building this society and giving the best of themselves , are deprived of their collective bargaining rights . 
among the great international tools used for the promotion of human rights , we know very well that the right to collective bargaining is at the very top of the list of rights that are recognized . 
i know that certain government members went to law school . 
how could we , as parliamentarians , accept today that workers be denied this right ? 
we cannot accept it , we will not accept it , and we will always be there to fight that battle . 
let us talk about poverty . 
let us talk about what the government has managed to do concerning the issue of poverty . 
where is the just society promised by Pierre Elliott Trudeau when we know that 20 % of Canadians , due to government policies , are getting poorer ? 
who has solutions to propose for the fight against poverty ? 
certainly not members on the government side . 
i do not even want to look at them . 
who has solutions to offer ? 
the Bloc Quebecois has . 
our colleague from Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques fought to improve the employment insurance system . 
my colleague from Shefford had also interesting things to say on this issue . 
in a few hours , I will be tabling an anti - poverty bill . 
what is in an anti - poverty bill ? 
i would appreciate some sign of support for such a bill . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
Mr. R é al M é nard : 
this bill will call for the inclusion of social condition among prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act . 
the member for Outremont studied law , but that is not where he spent most of his time , because I am told he skipped his social law courses . 
he took criminal law , was very keen on business law , but he was not there for social law . 
had he taken the social law courses , he would know that social condition led , in Quebec , to the improvement of the Quebec charter of human rights , the most thorough legislation in Canada , which has contained provision on social condition since 1977 . 
this has led to a significant improvement in the situation of people on social welfare , single parents and persons with disabilities . 
imagine , as we speak , there are eight provinces with provisions on social condition , and the federal government is one of the last bastions permitting discrimination on such grounds . 
we will not tolerate that . 
i would hope that the member for Ottawa - Vanier will join with the Bloc Quebecois to speak with an enlightened voice for once . 
we have a whole lot of solutions to propose on the subject of poverty . 
all we ask is a little attention . 
we do not think this is too much . 
i would like those watching us this morning , with their orange juice and toast , to know that we have been sitting since Tuesday evening at 5:00 p.m. , that we have been the voice of the workers , and that we will not let these people be deprived of the right to collective bargaining . 
we will continue to be this voice in Parliament . 
we know that you cannot count on the ministers , and I do not pay them tribute . 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or - Cape Breton , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , it would be a lie for me to say that I am happy to be standing here in this early morning light trying to convince this Liberal government from riding roughshod again over the backs of Canadian workers . 
why is it that it always seems to be the Liberal government that has the most difficulty with the working people of this country organizing and standing up for their rights as equal citizens of this great country ? 
the Liberals , despite their lofty rhetoric , have always been the first to turn their guns , in some cases quite literally , on Canadian workers . 
i look to my own island of Cape Breton and talk to people of my grandparents ' generation . 
they remember the strikes of the twenties , thirties and forties . 
they remember a Liberal government that sent in soldiers to guard the property of British mine owners against the men who had worked and died in the pits , and that ordered Canadian soldiers to shoot Canadian workers on June 11 , 1925 . 
it is a transforming experience for any community to have the army that is sworn to protect you ride down your city streets with guns drawn and blazing . 
because you are a worker , because you refuse to stand the gaff of a government and society that treats you as a slave to foreign capitalists , you are now an enemy of the country you love . 
perhaps this is why Cape Bretoners have maintained a long and honourable tradition of union activism and have always been quick to speak out against oppression and exploitation . 
so it is that constituents from my riding support the Public Service Alliance of Canada members , the men and women who have in their hands the fragile structure of our public service ; our health care system , our parks and national monuments and the agencies that connect Canadians to their government . 
over the past seven years these people have been on the front line as the Liberals here in Ottawa sold off the family silver to pay off the deficit . 
not that that fight was not an important or necessary one . 
but why is it that the Liberal Party always seems to think that crises must be solved by attacking the middle class and working people ? 
why is that when they are presented with any dilemma they feel that they , the members of the private gentlemen ' s clubs of Ottawa , should create policies which the working people from coast to coast to coast are forced to pay for ? 
it is not the members of the government who have had to endure the cuts to health care . 
not so for most children who endure leaking roofs , old books , and teachers whose class sizes go up and up as their colleagues are fired or pushed into early retirement . 
no , it is a remarkable thing about the Liberal Party , this ability to hurt regular citizens and then to tell us that it is all for our own good . 
telling a senior citizen that because of cutbacks his drug plan will not be processed on time , that is for his own good . 
it is strange that the Liberal Party is viewed as the party of the centre in this country because when I look at its history I see a party that , when necessary , takes good ideas from wherever it can find them . 
i see a party that on its own has never had a good idea , that has never had any ideas beyond the absolute necessity of winning election after election , principles , policies and decency be damned . 
we are used to seeing the graveyards send ringing endorsements of Liberal candidates . 
for Liberals in my province , short term jobs with a Liberal contractor , just enough to qualify for EI , are the Liberals ' ideas of good social programs . 
that is why I have a tough time stomaching this government ' s endless speeches about how it is helping Canadians do this and that , how it has made life so much better for all of us , and how we should be grateful for the stewardship it has provided us . 
should my constituent who was refused federal housing assistance be happy for the piece of plastic sheeting that she uses as a roof for her trailer ? 
or the man who needs to decide between paying the rent that keeps him off the streets or paying for the drugs that keep him alive , should he be happy for that ? 
no doubt many people are happy with this government , the people that are in the top 1 % income bracket who run the corporations and own the banks that give such huge donations to the Liberal Party every year . 
those people who think Brian Mulroney was too progressive and too tough on business are thrilled with this government . 
of course they are . 
instead of government of the people by the people for the people , we have a government of the people by the Liberals for the Liberals . 
they too have learned what it is like to have the Liberals decide they are the enemies of their government . 
now we have the strike by the PSAC workers who are upset that they are paid one wage while their contemporaries are paid more or less depending on where they live . 
what is so bad about that ? 
it is a case of one rule for one and another for the other . 
while lower ranked staff are paid differential rates , their managers are not . 
here is a challenge for the Liberal members . 
if they are so supportive of regional discrimination as the President of the Treasury Board says he is , how about they volunteer here and now to have their salaries decided based on where they live . 
when I look across the way , it is no surprise that I do not see any takers . 
maybe they are too tired to jump on board , or maybe deep down they see the obvious , that this issue is not what the government says it is about . 
it is not about workers trying to sabotage Canada ' s public service . 
it is not about radical trade unionists trying to pull down the government . 
all this is is a group of Canadians supposedly protected under Canadian law and the Canada Labour Code . 
equal pay , equal standards . 
what is so hard to deal with in those four words ? 
equality has gone out of favour in this country . 
now this government , not happy with making the rich richer and the poor poorer , has decided to create artificial divisions from province to province , territory to territory . 
no , this is not a surprise . 
we expect nothing different from this government . 
that is why I am proud to sit on these benches , a member of the party that introduced universal health care and pensions to Canada , the party that believes in those things because they are right and not because it was electorally convenient to adopt them a few years ago . 
it is a party of conviction and principles and most important , a party that supports Canadian workers . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
the hon. member for St. John ' s West on debate . 
an hon. member : 
give it to them , Charlie . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I am not sure we have much left to give them . 
we have given them all our logic and all the benefit of our wisdom and the government members never seem to accept very much of it . 
i suspect it will not be any different this morning than it was last night , yesterday or last week . 
we have a few points to make about what has happened here in the last 24 hours . 
our caucus has a few things to say about how the government has handled this issue . 
yesterday when I first spoke on this matter I said that the government was acknowledging by the way it did this that it had two fundamental failures . 
one is its fundamental failure in how it runs this House . 
whenever the government House leader has to bring in closure , an act that takes away the rights of the members of this House of Commons , he acknowledges a failure in managing this place properly . 
if the government cannot manage its business any better , if it has to run from crisis to crisis , then maybe the government House leader should look at exactly how he does his job . 
the other failure was the failure of the President of the Treasury Board , the minister responsible for collective agreements , the minister responsible for making sure we have in place a collective bargaining process that has an opportunity to work . 
if there is a case where this pending strike has been ongoing and the collective agreement has been ongoing and needing to be negotiated for two years , why did we end up with 14 days of negotiation in two years ? 
what happened to all the other days in those two years that were not used to solve this problem ? 
that is why we have been here for the last 24 hours . 
the third mistake , if there was a mistake to be made worse than the other two , is how the House was managed last night . 
some people in the House had access before a crucial vote to very crucial information about a vote that we were taking about collective bargaining in Canada . 
why did the President of the Treasury Board and the government House leader not acknowledge that they knew an hour or so before any of us voted that there was a tentative agreement ? 
it is absolutely unfair and unacceptable . 
it may not be illegal but it certainly is immoral and unfair to all of us as members of the House of Commons to allow some persons to have knowledge before they vote and some persons to have that knowledge 40 or 50 minutes later , after the vote was taken . 
that is one of the reasons we spent most of the night here . 
the government did not give the opposition the facts . 
it did not give us the truth as to what was really happening . 
as long as those kind of things happen in this place , the opposition will fight for its rights . 
we will fight for the rights of Canadians who did not get a fair shake in this collective bargaining process . 
another strange thing happened last night that none of them seem to understand . 
what kind of logic is that ? 
if a collective agreement is negotiated in good faith and is accepted by members of PSAC , why are we taking away the right to strike from people who are not now on strike ? 
why was it not part of the negotiating process for the President of Treasury Board to simply ask the member of PSAC to give up their right to go on strike during the ratification process ? 
any agreeable , acceptable union would be happy to do that provided the government was fair enough to take away its right to rush in here and pass back to work legislation . 
my suspicion is that the government was not willing to give the union any assurance that it would not come in and pass back to work legislation . 
as a result , the union quite probably said that if the government would not relent on its back to work legislation it would not relent on its right to go on strike during the ratification process . 
it was all done very wrongly . 
the whole collective bargaining process is now wrong for all public servants of Canada . 
how can the issues they want to negotiate through the collective bargaining process be done ? 
there cannot be binding arbitration and there can only be strikes if it suits the employer . 
that is a no - brainer . 
who will go on strike ? 
who can go on strike ? 
the minute they do it is taken away through the process we have before us in the House of Commons . 
i will repeat today what I said yesterday . 
if workers are deemed essential , whether they are grain handlers , transportation workers or workers in prisons , and their services must be available for good governance in the country , they should be made essential workers and given binding arbitration . 
then most persons would accept as a fair and reasonable way to govern the taking away of their right to strike . 
in this case the workers have given up everything and the government very little . 
as a result we will continue to have a series of union and employer problems for many years to come . 
certainly from our point of view not only salary issues are involved . 
there is a terrible unconstitutional law that has been implemented by Treasury Board . 
a person in St. John ' s , Newfoundland , who does clerical work for the Government of Canada gets paid an entirely different wage from a person who does the same work in Calgary . 
how can there be discrimination in the country based upon where one happens to live ? 
i do not care about the business of disrupting labour markets . 
the minister thinks that if he pays an equivalent wage or a slightly higher wage to a person in St. John ' s , Newfoundland , than he pays to a person in Calgary he will disrupt the labour market in Newfoundland and will not be able to find employees for the private sector . 
the government does not know yet that there is a 35 % unemployment rate for young people in Newfoundland . 
it does not know that there is a 20 % unemployment rate for all adults in Newfoundland . 
there are no jobs . 
in the last three years we have lost 30,000 Newfoundlanders . 
is that labour market disruption ? 
is that affected by the Government of Canada paying lower wages in Newfoundland than in other places ? 
those are the kinds of things that have to be negotiated through collective agreements . 
all I can say about this process is that there does not seem to be a collective bargaining process any more . 
it is intimidation by the majority . 
it is bullying by government that forces people to accept certain things which are not acceptable to them in a normal , negotiating process . 
from the point of view of this caucus we are very disappointed that the Government of Canada tries to pit farmers against workers in Newfoundland . 
it is a totally wrong process . 
it is a disgusting process . 
the way members of the House of Commons were treated last night in the vote was disgusting . 
this party and this caucus do not vote for those kinds of shenanigans in the House , not now and not ever . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to join with all my colleagues who consider that the government acted in a very cavalier way , to say the least . 
the farce that took place last evening and last night left many members puzzled , particularly when they heard the President of the Treasury Board deliver his unexpected message around 2.30 a.m. , if I remember correctly . 
in my view , it was certainly unique . 
having been in the labour movement for 20 years , I know that with back to work legislation pending , usually , if the government reaches a last minute agreement , workers agree to go back to work . 
but the government went even further . 
the government did all it could to provoke this strike and then it did all it could to crush it . 
it could have crushed it just like that , without any offer from the workers . 
when it reaches an agreement at the last minute , I think it is important that the government say " Now , we will not add insult to injury and we will see to it that workers go back to work peacefully '' . 
one basic issue remains . 
what about the consequences ? 
what will the consequences be in a union where the majority of the 14,000 workers accepted the government ' s offers and still are subjected to back to work legislation ? 
there is a problem there , and there could be trouble . 
i am thinking in particular of the 400 workers at the military base in Saint - Jean . 
these 400 people are mechanics . 
these are people who make the lowest salaries in the federal public service . 
they looked at the negotiation process in general and saw the government make interesting offers to other tables . 
when their turn came , the government , which is both negotiator and legislator , said : " We do not have much money for you folks '' . 
these people felt let down . 
i think this will certainly have an impact on their productivity . 
to go back to work with a bowed head , with the feeling of having been whipped , is not always easy . 
people will say " Will I be loyal , totally loyal to my employer ? 
did my employer show me any respect ? " 
these are all questions that people are asking . 
perhaps they are not all great trade unionists , but they are fathers , mothers , ordinary people who ply their trade as best as they can , and after more than 6 years without a raise , several collective agreements were imposed on them . 
my colleague from Trois - Rivi è res explained that clearly - over a period of about 15 years , there may have been 11 imposed agreements . 
i think the aftermath is always difficult , in such cases . 
when a negotiator in the private sector goes and negotiates with a union , there is a power relationship that comes into play . 
if the right to strike is legal and workers exercise that right , everybody understands . 
however , the dynamic here today is very different , because the government is the entity that will be legislating should negotiations fail , and the government is in a position to make negotiations fail . 
i think that is what happened . 
this government made the negotiations fail in order to impose , by special legislation , a back to work order . 
i do not need to explain in any great detail that not only it imposed such legislation but also it did so after the employees , at the last minute , said " We have an agreement in principle , we are going back to work '' . 
so , I think this will be added to the government ' s record , a rather negative one , in my opinion , with respect to workers , because this is not the first time it shows it is anti - workers , and anti - unions too . 
i raised several examples the other day . 
a few examples come to my mind . 
there is the surplus in the federal public service pension fund , to which the President of the Treasury Board said they were going to help themselves . 
i made a connection with former Singer employees , the Singer retirees . 
for more than two years , I have been asking the government , as the trustee for that pension fund , to give that money back to the workers . 
there are no end of examples of this government ' s approach to labour relations with its employees and with the public in general . 
what kind of example is the government setting for employers today ? 
is it a positive one ? 
but it only works in the short term , because in the long term people are less productive , more disloyal , because they feel they have been let down by the government . 
other examples given here over the past weeks and months include the EI fund to which employers and employees contribute . 
once again , there is a huge surplus in this fund and the government should be using it to improve the system instead of using it to pay down the debt . 
so there is all sorts of evidence that this government is going after workers . 
this is a rather sad day for me . 
when one removes one ' s union hat , as I have , and dons the hat of an MP , one has to remain pretty open - minded because in society , in our riding offices , in the House here , we run into people from all walks of life . 
but is the first principle not to serve voters as well as possible ? 
has this government served voters well today ? 
at the last minute , even though it knows that this will not work , the government withdraws and says " Now I will act as a legislator and I will impose back to work legislation and set the working conditions myself '' . 
on behalf of the 400 people I represent at the Saint - Jean military base , I think things will not go easily today at the military base . 
of course , when I am back in my riding , I will contact the union president . 
however , I am proud that the Bloc Quebecois stood up throughout this debate . 
we have managed , so far for almost 36 hours , to prevent the government from rushing this legislation through the House . 
this is not the first time ; as I said in my speech , the Bloc Quebecois is the only party that has always defended the workers . 
when there was the postal strike or when the rail workers were legislated back to work , the Bloc Quebecois was on the side of the workers . 
hopefully , the workers will not forget that the Canadian government does not serve them . 
hopefully , people in Quebec will see that the Bloc Quebecois is on their side . 
fundamentally , it may have to do with our financing method , since many workers contribute to the Bloc Quebecois ' campaign fund , and they do not contribute thousands of dollars . 
we get $ 5 and $ 10 bills from unions and individuals . 
when the time comes to defend them , however , our hands are not tied , as the Liberal Party ' s are , by connections with the major corporations , and the big banks and insurance companies . 
when the time comes to force government workers back on the job , the Liberal Party will boast of it , for a multitude of reasons . 
they claim income tax return processing was slowing down and that grain was piling up in the west . 
these are nothing but pretexts . 
the government would have grabbed onto any pretext for accomplishing its ends . 
i believe the government is a far from exemplary employer , since it is sending such a negative message to all those who are required to negotiate collective agreements , whether in the public or the private sector . 
the Bloc Quebecois cannot , of course , subscribe to such a farce . 
tonight we have been the spectators and performers in another performance , a dramatic comedy . 
the government turned up with offers at the last minute . 
so there we were at 2.30 or 2.45 a.m. , saying " Hooray , at least we get to go to bed . 
it ' s over . " 
but this was far from being the case , for the President of Treasury Board arrogantly pulled his last ace out of his sleeve , and told us " We are still going to force these people back to work . 
we will continue with the legislation and we will take it to the very end '' . 
i repeat , this was just adding insult to injury . 
i am proud to say that not only did the Bloc oppose the measure from the beginning , but that it will oppose it to the very end . 
everybody had a hard night , but I think that the Bloc will be in a position to tell the workers , in my riding as well as in all of Quebec , that we tried to set an example and to make the government change its mind . 
people will go back to work . 
there was an agreement and we are now confident that people will go back to work . 
they don ' t want to have back to work legislation hanging over their head '' . 
in conclusion , I will say that the government used the House of Commons to force employees back to work and to threaten them to the very last minute , and when the employees signed the agreement , the government decided to go ahead with its strategy , just the same . 
i find it unconscionable as I said yesterday . 
it is a sad day for the Bloc and for the workers and I hope that the government will pay a political price for its actions . 
members of the Bloc who have federal employees affected by the bill in their riding will make a point of explaining to these workers what really happened . 
i am sure that the workers will support the Bloc and say that it took the right decision in staying up all night , for 36 hours , to defend them and to oppose the government , which once again proved that it is against unions and against workers . 
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , I would like to spend a short while discussing this back to work legislation . 
i do not want to get into how inappropriate and ineffective it is or the necessity of it . 
i want to talk about the impact the government ' s inaction can have on the community and the area I come from . 
in particular , I want to talk about the government ' s inability to come to an agreement with the grain handlers . 
quite often when we discuss this issue the first issue of concern is the prairie farmer which is only right . 
whether they be primary producers of grain , the forest workers , or in the fishing community , the primary producers always seem to get the short end of the stick . 
i certainly have a great deal of sympathy for the impact any delay in the transfer station system can have on the prairie farmer . 
somewhere along the line somebody is missing the boat . 
somebody does not understand how the transportation system works . 
somebody does not understand that since the Crow rate was removed , the ports of Vancouver and Prince Rupert , and the Fraser port to a lesser extent , on the west coast are not so much in competition with one another as they could be in competition with American ports . 
this is simply because of the ease with which farmers could transport their grain south of the border and ship it through the port of Portland or even the port at Sacramento , California . 
the possibility exists that the competition for British Columbia ports is not among themselves but it very well could be with ports south of the border . 
if a trickle of grain starts being shifted south of the border even down to the Mississippi , in short order there is going to be a flood . 
that is the key issue in my view . 
how do we protect the transportation route and keep that grain going out through the port of Vancouver ? 
i think the government has completely ignored this issue . 
the matter of the grain handlers is only one small issue . 
the taxation regime and so on which our railways have to cope with is far in excess of that which the American lines have to cope with . 
sooner or later that grain is going to be shifted south of the border and with it will go a great deal of prosperity . 
the dollars that accrue to Vancouver through the shipment of prairie grain are huge and we should not ignore that . 
this action taken by the government was unnecessary . 
had it bargained honestly and openly in the beginning , an agreement could have been reached with the workers . 
that was demonstrated last night when an hour before he made the announcement in the House , the President of the Treasury Board was aware that an agreement had been reached , an agreement which should probably allow the continued shipment of grain through the port of Vancouver . 
if that agreement could be reached last night , it certainly could have been reached a week ago . 
the money was obviously there to satisfy those people . 
another aspect of this bill which concerns me has to do with the prison guards who are also part of this negotiating table . 
i do not think anybody in my community would resent those guards being given a substantial raise . 
the work they do is dangerous . 
the support they have had from the government is almost non - existent . 
it is a job I sure as heck would not want and I do not think too many people in this chamber would want . 
i do not think those people have received the respect they deserve from the government . 
it is sad that it has come to that . 
when we look at the wages these people are paid in comparison to police officers , it is simply an outrage . 
why money could not be found to pay these people the kind of dollars they are worth is simply beyond me . 
why back to work legislation has been used when nobody is off the job is a mystery to me . 
if these people are essential workers , then treat them as essential workers . 
bring in essential legislation that would define them as such and let us get on with life . 
but do not impose back to work legislation on them when it is inappropriate , as it is today . 
i reiterate the despair I feel in the fact that the government has simply neglected the country ' s transportation system . 
the Vancouver , Prince Rupert and Fraser ports face a peril if more care is not taken to ensure that the transportation system in Canada remains viable and competitive with that of our American neighbours . 
as I said earlier , it only would take a trickle of grain to find its way over the border , down through the rail system to the ports along the west coast or down to the Mississippi and there will be a flood . 
the cost and loss to Canadian taxpayers , and the job losses in Canada , will be huge . 
i urge the government to wake up . 
it has been a long night but it is time to wake up and address this issue in the way it should . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
madam Speaker , I do have a question for the hon. member who just spoke . 
it is a valuable point to raise concerning the problem we will be running into with our transportation system and the total lack of vision the government has shown . 
why bargain ? 
why is there a bargaining system in place ? 
it begs the question . 
either there is a system where people sit down and discuss issues in a reasonable and rational manner and come up with solutions , and then abide by those solutions , or there is not . 
the government has completely turned its back on that system . 
it is a travesty of justice without question . 
the grain handlers are just an excuse for the government . 
it was a convenient excuse for the government to force everybody back to work after it had already worked with them . 
there is something seriously wrong . 
we sat here all night and discussed the bill and participated in vote after vote after vote and clause by clause consideration in committee in the whole . 
the Liberals can blame it on the grain handlers or blame it on PSAC . 
they can try to create all the bogeymen that we want to create , but the fact is that those are not the problems . 
the problem is the Government of Canada that was looking for a stakeout to begin with . 
it is very unfortunate . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , I agree with the concerns my friend has raised . 
these freighters may look pretty sitting out there in English Bay riding high at anchor , but they are costing prairie farmers a lot of money when they are not moving . 
a couple of years ago during the winter we had huge problems with the shipment of grain . 
the rail lines were not operating properly . 
the money was not there although taxes were high . 
the government is simply ignoring the very critical transportation problem on the west coast . 
sooner or later we will wake up one day and the grain will be going south of the border , in which case we will be short a huge number of jobs in western Canada and a lot of money . 
we need action from the government on this very critical issue . 
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus é jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) : 
madam Speaker , what does my colleague in the Reform Party think of legislating workers who are not even on strike ? 
this is what is happening . 
i have a serious problem with back to work legislation , to start with , but even more of a problem with legislating something that is not happening yet . 
we are living in a democratic country . 
the prison guards are not on strike . 
let us face it . 
they have been working and getting paycheques , but the government acts as if they have been on strike all this time . 
i guess it got a pretty good deal , if we look at it that way . 
what is the member ' s feelings on legislating workers that are not on strike ? 
Mr. John Cummins : 
madam Speaker , I think it is an outrage . 
either we have a collective bargaining process and allow it to work , or we do not . 
it is as simple as that . 
everybody who has worked for a large corporation or in the government service understands and appreciates the fact that they have a union protecting them . 
they have union protection and unions bargaining for them . 
to order people back to work when they have not gone on strike is an absolute outrage . 
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , how does my colleague from British Columbia feel about the farmers who found a market in 1993 for grain which was designated poisonous and unsaleable ? 
grain companies could not handle it . 
Dan Sawatzky beat the case . 
the government lost the appeal and is still prosecuting 170 farmers for moving grain that nobody wanted to buy . 
is that human rights abuse or what is it ? 
how can the government let something like that go ahead ? 
i would like the member ' s impression on that . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
it took fishermen to court because they defied the minister ' s regulation which the joint House of Commons and Senate Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations declared to be invalid . 
yet the government has continued to arrest people and to take them to court over regulations that are invalid , regulations which a provincial court judge and the Supreme Court of British Columbia have declared invalid . 
the government continues to harass fishermen , to take them to court and to put them in jail over an issue when it is the minister who is breaking the law . 
i do not know as much about the issue as my friend , but I know the government is perfectly capable of putting farmers in jail for standing up for their rights . 
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) : 
madam Speaker , finally we have awakened what the government has been trying to put to sleep for the last couple of years . 
i want to address that issue further . 
farmers started exporting that worthless wheat and saved taxpayers millions of dollars . 
after they had developed a market the government interfered . 
the government appealed that . 
then what happened ? 
the government lost . 
has the government dealt in good faith with anybody ? 
if it is allowed to continue , we might as well shut down the House or burn it down because it would be useless . 
people are being mistreated . 
people are in jail . 
what can we do ? 
why did people send us here ? 
why are we sitting back and allowing it to happen ? 
there is a trial in Brandon , Manitoba , on the same issue . 
if members want to know if I am telling the truth , they should come to Brandon , Manitoba . 
now there is a suspicion that even court documents have been doctored to prosecute the farmers . 
what next ? 
we have a prime example of what has happened over on that side . 
we have a prime example that we have a government that is worse than the Mulroney government . 
why should people support it ? 
in the next election they will show the government where to go , out the door .
