Mr. Bill Blaikie : 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i believe that only a few minutes ago you asked members of parliament who were playing cards to stop playing cards . 
in all my years here , I have never seen anybody play cards in the House until the Reform Party came along . 
that is the truth . 
i think it is very disrespectful of this place . 
if this business is as serious as the Reform Party members think it is , because they have imposed it on us , the least they should do is sit there , take the whole process seriously and not play cards while this is going on . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i am a little shocked at this coming from the member . 
this is the party that took a dead salmon and threw it on somebody ' s desk . 
these guys think they have decorum down pat . 
i do not think they have anything to teach anybody about this place . 
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
at this point , I must insist that all hon. members respect the rules and stop playing cards .

Mr. Pierre de Savoye : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i noticed that because some hon. members have the same surname , they have the privilege of having the names of their ridings mentioned , so as distinguish them from one another . 
the riding of Portneuf is as nice a riding as any . 
i would therefore ask the House to give its unanimous consent so that , from now on , all members who are here enjoy the privilege of having the names of their ridings mentioned . 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .

Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
would you clarify what you mean by next time around ?

Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , we appreciate the motion was accepted by the House and I wish to explain one situation . 
when voting took place on Motion No. 356 , I believe it was , and the Table is trying to confirm it for me , the Speaker did not acknowledge voters subsequent to my colleague who did not initially stand . 
that would include seven other members who were in the same position as the hon. member mentioned in this motion just approved in the House .

they should have stood up .

order , please . 
it is very late in the early morning and many of you have been in here for all the votes . 
if we had it to do over again , some things would possibly have been done differently .

would the hon. member name those members for me ?

Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
throughout the course of this voting that has been going on for the last couple of days , I have noticed that quite often you have mentioned the person who moved the motion and the person who seconded it . 
you always read that out as necessary , but on occasion I have noticed that the person who has moved the amendment may not be in their seat . 
i seconded most of these motions , and I am almost always here , but the person who moved the motion was not necessarily in his or her seat at the time you read that . 
could you explain whether that is in order or whether that is a problem ? 
it does seem to me that is different than normal procedure . 
could you explain that , Mr. Speaker . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i appreciate the very kind assistance of the chief opposition whip in this matter . 
i must say that the same thought occurred to me and I wondered if I should not just rule the motion out of order , but I was afraid that doing such a thing would upset the chief opposition whip more than allowing the motion to proceed . 
i decided that since most of these motions were deemed put to the House at some earlier stage , I would treat them all as having been deemed put . 
that is why I have allowed some of these motions to go , although the thought has occurred to me , as it obviously has to the chief opposition whip . 
i am glad he has thought of this . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
i just want to be sure that we have actually deferred all 471 amendments , that they have been deemed put and obviously seconded and that it is in order that we are proceeding this way . 
i think it is , but I think the motion passed by the House kind of supersedes the standing orders and that everything should be in order for the way we are proceeding . 
that is just to confirm that . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i can safely confirm that to the chief opposition whip . 
i have proceeded on exactly the same assumption .

Mr. Gilles - A . 
Mr. Speaker , I think that during the last division you missed my vote . 
i would like to be recorded as having voted like the members of the Bloc Quebecois . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i can assure the hon. member that his vote was recorded . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
the member who just rose in his place to be counted with his party , the Bloc Quebecois , could you confirm whether that included if he had been in his place or that he actually was in his place and was counted . 
i think there is a difference . 
could you clarify that for us ? 
the Deputy Speaker : 
the Table assures me that he was counted when the vote was taken . 
accordingly I assume that he must have been in his place to be counted .

Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i wonder if you could confirm something for us . 
i believe the member for Surrey Central has voted on every single motion and amendment during this whole process . 
i wonder if you could confirm that for me , and whether anyone else in the House has actually voted on every single amendment to date . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i know the hon. member has a great fascination with votes in the House and I applaud him for that . 
i was told last night that the hon. member for Surrey Central was in fact voting every time . 
i assume he has stayed here ever since , but I have not been here the whole time . 
i suggest that if the hon. chief opposition whip would like to know who voted every time , when the House adjourns Hansard will be printed which will list everything . 
he will be able to look in there and satisfy his intense curiosity on this point , as will all hon. members .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
you mentioned that this review would be tabled in the House of Commons on July 1 in the year 2000 , but the House of Commons does not normally sit on that day . 
i wonder if you could explain how a motion can be tabled when the House is not sitting and whether that motion is in order because it refers to a date when parliament is normally not in session .

it would hardly be the role of the Speaker to explain to the seconder of the motion what he meant by the motion .

Mr. Chuck Strahl : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
we have dealt now with a series of amendments that bring this into force on September 1 or October 1 . 
they have all been defeated one after the other . 
however , could you confirm that it is not important that it be on the first of the month that those things come into force . 
it could be any day of the week , as long as it is put off far enough into the future to have a good evaluation of the impacts of the treaty . 
the Deputy Speaker : 
i am afraid I cannot answer the hon. member ' s question . 
i do notice a great similarity in the motions and that is why I am surprised that we are not applying votes because they are so similar . 
there does not seem to be agreement in the House to do that . 
perhaps we could just continue with the next motion , which is 2008 , a new year . 
Mr. John Cummins : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
i keep seeing the word " force " here .

the wonderful thing , as the hon. member for Delta - South Richmond knows , is that when voting on technical amendments like this it helps to have the statute in front of us .

business OF THE HOUSE 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
by the way , this has nothing to do with what we are doing right now , so members may know , but it is closely related . 
i move : 
that , when proceedings are interrupted pursuant to Standing Order 81 ( 17 ) in the supply period ending December 10 , 1999 , the motion then before the House shall be deemed to have been put and a division thereon requested and ordered deferred to the conclusion of Government Orders on Monday , December 13 , 1999 , provided that , immediately after the said division is disposed of , the Speaker shall put , without debate or amendment , every question necessary for the disposal of any opposition motion , motion to dispose of any item or items or opposed item or items in supplementary estimates and , notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order 71 , for the passage at all stages of any bill or bills based thereon , and further provided that the result of any division on any motion to dispose of any item or items or opposed item or items in supplementary estimates shall be deemed applied to all subsequent questions put pursuant to this order . 
Mr. John Williams : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
was that a clear question ? 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
it was clear to me . 
if the House would like , I would be happy to repeat it . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , I will explain . 
it means that the supply votes which would have been held on Friday will be deferred to Monday . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
that is very clear to me . 
Mr. Darrel Stinson : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
only the government could complicate something so simple that bad . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
does the leader of the government in the House have the unanimous consent of the House to present the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?

business OF THE HOUSE 
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I wish to seek consent of the House that we adopt the motion previously read . 
i am just going to save people from reading it to them again . 
regarding the motion read a few moments ago , would you please ask if the motion could now be adopted ? 
i believe you might find consent now . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
just to be clear , without reading the motion in its entirety , it is to move the vote from Friday to Monday . 
that is the same motion that the government House leader read in its entirety a few minutes ago . 
we will start over again and we will do it in two steps . 
does the government House leader have the unanimous consent to present the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion as presented by the government House leader ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
Mr. Randy White : 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
given that the House leaders have not met this week because of the changes that occurred in the House and also that there has been no notice paper for the last several days , I wonder if the House leader for the government could possibly inform us as to what the nature of the business of the House will be for the remainder of this week , given that we are also past 10 a.m. this morning , and also the nature of the business for next week . 
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
perhaps the opposition House leader would provide an opportunity for the government House leader to come back to the House , or he can do it now . 
hon. Don Boudria : 
Mr. Speaker , because of the , shall I say , extenuating as opposed to exhausting circumstances , I will not be able to provide a full report now , but at least for the next couple of days there will be discussions among the House leaders . 
tomorrow will be the last day in the supply cycle to discuss the estimates of the President of the Treasury Board and any votes in opposition to those . 
on Monday we would have the third reading of the Nisga ' a final agreement bill . 
at the end of the day we will vote on that . 
as well there will be the votes on supply deferred pursuant to the agreement made a few moments ago . 
i will get back to the House very shortly about the business for next Tuesday and Wednesday . 
i think I have a draft solution but not everyone has been consulted . 
hopefully we can agree to that very quickly .
